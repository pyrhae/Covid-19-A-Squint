{"./":{"url":"./","title":"Initial page","keywords":"","body":"Initial page On 23rd January 2020, news about the Wuhan lockdown spread on the internet. At that time, I was at home, in rural Hunan, hearing this news shook me to my core. Today, the 22nd April 2020, this disaster is still unfolding. I begin to record these events, considering them to be a turning point in China's history and also a milestone in modern human history. What should we believe? Is the slight murmuring which is rumbling and lingering in the crannies of web platforms something to pay attention to? They are covered up by the Chinese style of political correctness、through information blockouts and misleading the public. Finally, different opinions of different political stands and different requests of different groups, are completely suppressed by one loud voice. People are indifferent and unconcerned about politics, for they are scared by politics. Yet politics, if malicious, will always reappear in different forms of oppression and exploitation. What should we expect? Will it be a century or longer of suffering manipulation and deception by a dictatorial government which derives from several thousand years of feudalism. Does this ancient race still have a future? The events of this virus, in reality are a post-modern inquiry for humankind. More and More high level technologies were introduced in confronting the virus, which have placed freedom in danger. Globalization has become a joke, so has the conception of a common destiny for all mankind. The chasm between the dictatorial world and the free world has torn the flattering face of capitalism into pieces. Humankind is oblivious to history, every generation comes from nothing and the ignorant. Perhaps this event is just another event like SARS or Tiananmen, and the Chinese know almost nothing about it whilst humankind pretends they know almost nothing about it too. There is no hope for this country, so long as what has been stated and shown here is still not permitted to spread freely. Here, what I am recording, what I am thinking, is all based on a stand of anti-dictatorship. I want to record how this Leviathan is stepping into decay now. Though the descent had begun in 2019, 2020 is worthier of record. This year, the virus came from the unknown, and owing to globalization and capitalism, it has been rampaging all over the world under the cover of dictatorship of China. Those empty cities, those deadly quiet streets, depict to us a kind of Doomsday. Some have said, the earth is a cliff, and civilization is a two hundred year train. \"The world is getting worse and worse, reaching a state from which it cannot be pulled back, just like a train rushing towards cliff, and falling down it. The civilisation is the result of 200 years of falling.\" If this is going to be true, I hope our contemporaries and future generations will never forget it. In the 200 years that form our collective memory, in the 200 years of modern civilization, may people remember for whom the bell tolls. Civilizations have been taking a long long time to get to this level, but, the destruction of it only takes a second.

一位援鄂医生，讲述了她在武汉一家医院工作41天平安归来之后，接受高规格待遇的受之有愧…… 由于某些原因，本文不具名址，亦不配医生图片。 下文讲述｜吐真言的医生 整理｜晓子君 （1） 医院发出通知那天，我在休假。 主任在科室群里说，医院援助武汉有8个名额，分到咱们科室有两个。 我没有回复。二宝还不到一岁，还不会叫妈妈，老公刚刚做了一个小手术在休养，家里的事，里外都需要我忙，说实话，看到主任的通知，我第一反应是：我不主动报名，但如果组织需要我，点了将，我会无条件前往武汉。 有两个同事很快回复，主动请战。 其中，有一个同事是聘用合同工，她希望能有更好发展，主动请战不难理解。另一个同事和我的情况差不多。 挺惭愧的，纠结要不要主动报名时，主任来电话了，征求我意见。电话里，他强调了我业务能力强。 我没有犹豫，表示会克服一切困难，前往武汉。 我写下请战书，签下生死状，和医院另几名同事一起，前往省城，跟来自全省内各地医院的同行集结，坐飞机前往武汉。 （2） 我是第一批援鄂医务人员，被分配到武汉市一家医院参与新冠肺炎的救治工作。 情况，比我想像中要严重很多。那些场面，就像打仗。不想过多描述疫情暴发高峰期，病人一床难求，以及临死前的凄惨。有一个事实是，一些媒体高调宣扬医务人员防护装备严重不足，只是个别医院存在的现象。我所在的医院，医务人员的防护设备，是齐全且充足的。 相反，我注意到，那些和我们在一线，从事清洁工作的工人，防护设备，还没有我们的好。仅我所在的那家医院，因为防护不到位而感染新冠肺炎的清洁工，就有好几个。 有一个清洁大妈，在我值晚班时，来到我的临时办公室，给了我一包方便面，然后怯声问我，你们用的那种防护品，我能不能买到几套？ 她解释，她是一个公司临时招来的，被分到医院的重症区做清洁工，公司统一配发了防护设备，她担心口罩和护手套等反复使用会增加感染机率，想备一些专用的防护品。 我送给她几个口罩和几双手套。 交流中，得知她是滞留在武汉的外地人，因为封城回不了家，她和丈夫看到有公司招临时工，分配到医院做清洁工，每天有600元报酬时，就报了名，夫妻俩分别被分配到两家医院上班，专门负责医院的垃圾清运。 （3） 身为医务人员，在一线和感染者打交道，你们从新闻上看到我们工作时的苦和累，都是真实的。因为穿着厚厚的防护服，我们长时间不能上洗手间，生理期血尿混和一起，也是真实的。长时间戴着口罩，脸上勒出血痕，也是真实的。 清洁大妈们，累了，就蹲在医院过道的角落睡觉，也是真实的。 他们没有厚厚的防护服，活动的范围却在重病感染区，也是真实的。 他们没有住高档酒店的待遇，也是真实的。 那些天，打开手机，满屏都是对医务人员的至高称赞，但媒体对那些干着最脏的活，冒着同样风险的底层人，鲜有报道。甚至，他们承担的感染风险，比医生更高，因为他们不是医生专业，没有医生更懂得如何自我保护。 说句心里话，我很失望。 我想起我的同行，写的一首诗，很有感触： 请不要给我花环，不要给我掌声 也不要什么工伤、烈士，几等功 来武汉，我不是来欣赏樱花的 也不是来风花雪夜、接受吹捧 只想疫情结束能安全回家…… 如果可以，请你们去看看 那些灭顶的家门，是否升起了炊烟 （4） 在武汉期间，很多故事，令我感动。 我们住的酒店，离医院虽然不远，但我们来的最初那些天，是没有通勤车的。令我们感动的是，有一天下班后，有武汉志愿者在医院门口等我们，车上写着标语：接白衣战士专用车。 那一刻，我感动得流下了眼泪！后来才知道，这些人，都是自发组织，免费接送我们上下班的。 还有人免费给我们送餐，甚至我们都不知道他们的名字。 同事和我说，武汉人懂得感恩。 我认为，我看到的清洁工，志愿者，还有运尸人，这些我们叫不出名字的人，这些和我们一样，决战疫情的人，他们的付出，不是为了让我们感恩的。 就如我来武汉，并不是，为了让武汉人感恩于我。我只不过是，在执行岗位职责。相比之下，那些冒着风雪，凌晨还奔波在武汉空冷的大街上的志愿者们，那些拿命博一份收入的清洁工、运尸人，他们干的却是额外的工作，他们何尝又不是在为武汉拼命？ （5） 在武汉工作了41天，我们第一批援鄂医务人员，踏上归途。 大巴从酒店驶出来，武汉交警以“最高礼遇、最深敬意、最佳形象”护航我们返程。 路边，群众挥手致敬。 场面真的好感人。一车的人，都哭得稀里哗拉。 回到家乡，刚下飞机，家乡的交警同样以“最高礼遇、最深敬意、最佳形象”护航我们回家。 路边，群众挥手致敬。 场面一样的感人，大家一样哭得稀里哗拉。 我也哭了。 武汉人民十里相送，家乡人民夹道欢迎。抗疫期间待遇提高二倍，全国多地景区免费让我们游玩，部分酒店免费让我们入住，而且，还被称之为“英雄”，我很欣慰我是一名医务人员，得到了应该得到的尊重与厚爱。 （6） 在家乡酒店隔离期间，情绪慢慢平复下来后，不知怎么的，我的脑海里，反复浮现出，我在武汉经历的那些人，那些事。 那些清洁工们，回家了吗？他们的归途，又是怎样的一番景象？ 那些无偿接我们上下班、为我们提供免费餐的志愿者们，他们回家了吗？他们的归途，又是怎样的一番景象？ 那些在白天和黑夜，忙着搬运遗体的运尸人，他们回家了吗？他们的归途，又是怎样的一番景象？ 我翻出那个问我要防护品的大妈微信，问她回家乡了没。 她说，还没回，年前来武汉，就是来为老公看病的，没想到遇到疫情困了这么多天，等几天带老公看病住院。 她跟我说了个事，公司结算时，只按200元一天给她算工资，并不是招聘时承诺的600元一天结算。 我的心堵得难受。想想，真是悲愤！我们医务人员，援鄂归来，是临时工的，马上解决编制，那个清洁大妈，却连承诺的工钱，都被黑掉一大半！ （7） 在媒体的聚光灯下，我是战疫英雄。 在媒体人的笔下，我不计报酬，我不论生死。 我，一名医务人员，因为恪尽职守，被宣扬“悲壮出征”。媒体聚焦下，我成了光环人物。 真的想说声抱歉。 这份荣光，我受之有愧！ 医生拿命救武汉，因感染壮烈在岗位上，被评为烈士，值得表彰。但有多少非医务人，每天都在重症区域清理卫生，每天都在无偿为我们提供暖心服务，每天都和感染治疗无效死亡的遗体零接触，他们当中，有多少人感染了新冠肺炎，又有多少人因为感染而去世？ 这是没有数据的。即便有数据，也是绝不会被评为烈士，受到表彰的。 真的想说声抱歉。 这份荣光，我受之有愧！ 我们在灾难中冲锋在前，人们选择性地忘记我们本来就是从事这个职业，就如，消防战士在灾难中冲锋在前，拿命守护岁月静好。 是不是，欠了那些消防人员救火归来的十里相送、夹道欢迎？ 是不是，欠了那些默默无闻的清洁工归来的十里相送、夹道欢迎？ 是不是，欠了那些不留名不为名的志愿者们归来的十里相送、夹道欢迎？ 如果压根不欠，那么，我凭什么要享受这样的荣光？凭什么接受如此礼遇还能自豪？ （8） 我想说。 我确实为武汉拼过命，我曾8小时没上洗手间，5小时没喝一口水，也曾昏倒过，至今因为戴口罩脸上还有印痕，配得上高规格的欢送和迎接，配得上鲜花和掌声，配得上组织上的表彰。 但我必须强调一个事实：我是一名医务工作者，我的职责就是治病救人，就如消防员的职责就是救火救人。 疫情已经控制住了，武汉，已经迎来了曙光，那些清洁工、运尸人、志愿者们，回家的回家，留下来的还在继续战斗，可是，谁会关注他们的命运？谁又在意着他们？ 他们，就像一粒粒尘埃，淹没在“十里相送、夹道欢迎”的光环之下。但在我看来，他们才是最有资格得到表彰的人！ 谢谢媒体对我的尊敬和赞赏，谢谢组织对我的厚爱。 我希望，媒体能够把镜头，对准那些在灾难中为了拯救一个个生命，而默默付出的人。他们的职业并不是医生，但他们面对的危险程度并不亚于我们，甚至因为非专业，比我们更危险。 我希望，祖国在为医务人员奋战疫情考虑各种福利的同时，也能想到成千上万个清洁大妈，我以为，他们，不应该被遗忘。 这就是我想说的真话。也是心里话。我不希望听到谁叫我英雄，那些同样为武汉拼过命的底层人，被忽视之，所以，我认为，英雄的称谓，让我受之有愧！ 以上所有，仅代表我个人的观点，不代表同行的观点和立场。 最后，谢谢接送过我上下班的志愿者，谢谢那个给过我一包方便面的清洁大妈，你们温暖过我，也温暖过，这个世界。 By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布

You can completely look over the article by the link I have given above. On December 30, 2019, Affin received a virus test report for patients with unknown pneumonia. She circled the word “SARS coronavirus” in red. When asked by a college student, she took the report and circulated it. To this fellow student who is also a doctor. That night, the report spread to doctor circles in Wuhan, and those who forwarded the report included the eight doctors who were disciplined by the police. This caused trouble for Affin. As the source of the transmission, she was interviewed by the hospital disciplinary committee and suffered “unprecedented and severe rebuke”, saying that she was making rumors as a professional. According to some previous reports, Affin was called “another female doctor who has been instructed to surface,” and some people called her a “whistleblower”. It was the “whistler”. This is the second report of “People” March cover “Doctor Wuhan”. The text message from Affin, the director of the emergency department of Wuhan Central Hospital, agreeing to be interviewed, was sent at 5 am on March 1. About half an hour later, at 5.32 am on March 1, her colleague and director of thyroid and breast surgery Jiang Xueqing was infected with New coronavirus pneumonia, died. Two days later, Mei Zhongming, deputy director of ophthalmology at the hospital, died. He and Li Wenliang were in the same department. As of March 9, 2020, 4 members of the medical staff of Wuhan Central Hospital have died of new coronavirus pneumonia infection. Since the outbreak, this hospital, just a few kilometers away from the Huanan Seafood Market, has become one of the hospitals in Wuhan with the largest number of employees that are infected. According to media reports, more than 200 employees in the hospital were infected, including three deputy deans and multiple working department directors. Multiple department directors are currently being maintained with ECMO(extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). The shadow of death hangs over this, Wuhan’s largest tertiary hospital. A doctor told People[a news site – EB] that in the social media group of hospital staff, almost no one spoke publicly;they mourned and discussed in private. There was a chance to avoid tragedy. On December 30, 2019, Affin received a virus test report for a patient with an unknown pneumonia. She circled the word “SARS coronavirus” in red. When asked by a college classmate who is also a doctor, she took a picture of the report and circulated it. That night, the report spread in doctor circles in Wuhan, and those who forwarded the report included the eight doctors who were disciplined by the police. This caused trouble for Affin. As the original source of the information, she was interviewed by the hospital disciplinary committee and suffered an “unprecedented and severe reprimand”;it was said that she was acting unprofessionally by creating false rumors. In the afternoon of March 2nd, Affin did an interview with People in the Nanjing Road location of Wuhan Central Hospital. She was sitting alone in the emergency room office. The emergency department, which had been admitting more than 1,500 patients a day, had returned to quiet. There was only one tramp lying in the emergency hall. Some previous reports called Affin “another severely reprimanded female doctor who has emerged” and some people called her a “whistleblower”. Affin corrected this; she said she was not a whistleblower, but the one who distributed the \"whistles\". During the interview, Affin mentioned the word “regret” several times, and said she deeply regretted that she hadn't continued to whistle resoundingly after she was reprimanded at a disciplinary review meeting. She has especial regrets when it comes to her deceased coworkers. \"If I had known that today, I wouldn't have cared about being criticized or not, I would have damned said everywhere, right?\" What have Wuhan Central Hospital and Affin experienced in the past two months or so? The following is what Affin told us— An unprecedented reprimand On December 16, last year, we received a patient at the Nanjing Road emergency department. They had an inexplicably high fever, and they weren't responding to the standard medications, their body temperature wasn't going down at all. On the 22nd, the patient was transferred to the respiratory department, a bronchoscopy was done, and bronchoalveolar fluid taken and sent out for high-throughput genetic sequencing. Afterwards, the coronavirus result was relayed verbally. At that time, the colleague who was responsible for the patient told me clearly:\"Director Ai, that person's diagnosis is coronavirus\". Later we learned that the patient was working in the Huanan Seafood Market. Immediately afterwards, December 27th, another patient arrived at Nanjing Road. He was the nephew of a doctor in our department. He was in his 40s, without any preexisting conditions. His lungs were in a terrible state, and his blood oxygen saturation was only 90%. He was under hospital care for almost 10 days without any improvement, and was admitted to the respiratory department. A flexible bronchoscopy was also done, and the alveolar lavage fluid sent for testing. At noon on December 30th, an old classmate at Tongji Hospital sent me a screenshot of a WeChat conversation, which said: “You don’t want to go to Huanan[Market] just now, there are lots of people with high fever …” He asked if it was true. At the time, I was watching a CT[scan] of a typical patient with pulmonary infection on the computer. I sent him a 11-second video of the CT and told him it was a patient who had come to our emergency department in the morning, a Huanan Seafood Market case. Just after 4 pm that day, a colleague showed me a diagnostic report that said:\"SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 strains of bacteria [bacteria and/or fungi] which colonize the oral cavity and/or respiratory tract”. I read the report very carefully many times, and the supplementary information read: “SARS coronavirus is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus. The main mode of transmission of the virus is close-range droplet transmission or contact with respiratory secretions of patients, which can cause an unusual pneumonia that is highly contagious and can affect multiple organ systems, also known as atypical pneumonia.” At the time, the diagnostic report scared me, I broke into a cold sweat, this was a terrifying thing. The patient was admitted to the respiratory department, the situation needed to be reported to the respiratory department, but to ensure attention, I immediately phoned and reported it to the hospital’s public health division and infectious disease [?院感] division. At that moment, the director of the respiratory department of our hospital happened to be passing my office door, someone who had been involved with SARS. I grabbed the director and said, “We found this in one of the patients in your department.” The director took one look and said it was worrying. I knew the matter was worrying. After calling the hospital, I also circulated this report to my fellow-learners (同学[; student or former classmate]). I purposely drew a red circle around the words “SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 strains of bacteria [菌, bacteria and/or fungi] which colonize the oral cavity and/or respiratory tract” to bring the warning to their attention. I also sent the report to the doctors in the department to warn everyone to take precautions. That evening, the message was spread widely; the screenshots of the transmission show the photos of the report I'd marked with a red circle, including the ones that I later learned that Li Wenliang passed on to the [chat] group. At that time, I was thinking it might be bad. At 10:20, the hospital passed on a message[reportedly on the Central Hospital WeChat group]. It was a relayed notification from the city Health Protection Committee (市卫健委). Their main point was that information on the pneumonia of unknown cause should not be arbitrarily released, to avoid causing panic among the public; if panic was caused by information leakage, there would be a thorough investigation (要追责). I was very scared at the time and immediately passed this information to my fellow-learners. About an hour later, the hospital sent another notice, again stressing that information the group had on this subject could not be leaked. One day later, at 11:46 pm on January 1st, the head of the hospital's disciplinary inspection committee sent me a message to come [for an employee review] the next morning. I didn’t fall asleep that night, I was worried and thought things through over and over again, but I felt that there are always two sides to everything;even if it had caused adverse effects, it was not necessarily a bad thing to remind medical staff in Wuhan to take precautions. At 8 o’clock the next morning, before I finished the shift, I was called in for the disciplinary review. In that disciplinary review, I suffered an unprecedented and very severe reprimand. At that time, the leader of the discussion said, “We ca n’t afford to raise our heads when we go out for a meeting. The director of XX criticizes our hospital. As the director of the emergency department of Wuhan Central Hospital, you are a professional,how can there be this lack of principle, this lack of organizational discipline, this creating and spreading of false rumours ?” This is the original sentence. So I should go back to the 200-odd peeple in the department to convey the news to them verbally, one by one; We can’t send information by WeChat or SMS, we can only talk face-to-face or call, we can’t say anything about this pneumonia, “you can’t even tell your own husband”, they said… I was utterly stunned. I hadn’t been criticized for not working hard, but made to feel that what I’d done had ruined Wuhan’s prospects and its future. I felt strong depair. I am a serious and hard-working person. I felt that everything I had done was in accordance with the rules and well-founded. What did I do wrong? After I red the lab result, I had also reported it to the hospital. My students and my colleagues had communicated among ourselves abouthow to handle the condition of a patient,we hadn't given out any of the patient's personal information;this is equivalent to discussing a medical case among medical students.As a clinical doctor, I already knew that a very important virus had been found in patients. When other doctors asked, how could you not say so? This is your instinct as a doctor, right? What did I do wrong? I have done what a doctor and a person should normally do. I think anyone would do the same. I was very emotional at the time, saying that I had done this, and it had nothing to do with the rest of the people; you can just arrest me and jail me. I said that I was not suitable to continue to work in this position and I wanted to take a break. The leader did not agree, saying that this was the time to test me. I went home that night, I remember it quite clearly, I told my husband just after I walked in the door, if something goes wrong, you must care for and raise the child -- because my second treasure is still very young, only just over 1 year old. At the time, my husband was perplexed by this. I didn’t explain. On January 20th, after Zhong Nanshan[prominent Chinese epidemiologist] told people[about the epidemic], I told my husband what had happened that day. In the interim, I just warned my family not to go to crowded places, and to wear surgical face masks when going out. Peripheral department Many people worry that I was among the eight people who were admonished [by police]. In fact, I wasn't warned by the Public Security Bureau. Later, a good friend asked me, are you a whistleblower? I said that I am not a whistleblower, I am the one who sent the whistle. But that disciplinary review hit me hard, it affected me very severely. When I came back, I could see that everyone’s morale had collapsed. We had been working with such drive and dedication, and doing our jobs conscientiously. Everyone kept asking me questions, and I couldn’t answer. All I could do iwas get the emergency department to focus on protection. We have over 200 people in the emergency department. From January 1st, I asked everyone to strengthen their protection. Everyone must wear masks, hats, and use gloves (用手快消). I remember one day, there was a nurse who did not wear a mask during the shift; I scolded him then and there, saying “Don’t come to work without a mask in the future”. On January 9th,while off-shift, I saw a patient coughing on the pre-examination table. From that day on, I asked everyone to put a mask on both the patient and on anyone seeing the patient, one for each person. I said, don’t try to save money at this time. At the time, they were still telling us that there was no human-to-human transmission, and I want to emphasize here that wearing a mask to strengthen protection was a big issue. That time was really depressing and very painful. Some doctors proposed wearing the out layer of isolation clothing. The hospital’s internal operations committee (医院里开会) said they wouldn’t allow it; they said that wearing isolation clothing would cause panic. I asked the people in the department to wear an isolation gown inside a white coat. This was out-of-specification and ridiculous. We watched more and more patients arrive, as the radius of the infection area became larger and larger. At first, they might be connected to the Huanan Seafood Market; then it spread, and the radius became larger and larger. Many of the cases were family-transmitted. Among the first seven people, there was a case of infection in which the mother had given the son food. The clinic [dispensary? 诊所] boss got sick, infected by the patients who came for injections. It was very serious, whether they got infected or not. I knew there must be human-to-human transmission. If there was no human-to-human transmission, well, the Huanan Seafood Market had been closed on January 1, so why were there more and more patients? I often thought, if only they hadn’t reprimanded me like that, if they’d asked for details calmly, and then asked other respiratory experts to communicate with them, maybe the situation would be better, and I could at least communicate a bit more in the hospital. If everyone had been as alert on January 1, there would not be so many tragedies. On the afternoon of January 3, in the Nanjing Road Hospital, doctors of urology gathered to review the work of the senior director, 43-year-old Dr. Hu Weifeng (胡卫峰), who is now in emergency care; on the afternoon of January 8, the Nanjing Road Hospital Director [of thyroid and breast surgery] Jiang Xueqing (江学庆) also organized the first Wuhan City breast disease patient recovery get-together (武汉市甲乳患者康复联欢会), on the 22nd floor. On the morning of January 11, the department reported to me that Hu Ziwei (胡紫薇), a nurse in the emergency room of the emergency department, was infected. She’d be the first infected nurse in the central hospital. First-off, I called the Chief of the Medical Department to report it, and then the hospital held an emergency meeting. At the meeting we were instructed to change the report of “double lung infection, viral pneumonia?” to “scattered infection of both lungs” (“两下肺感染，病毒性肺炎？” to “两肺散在感染”). At the weekly meeting of January 16th, a deputy dean was still saying, “Everyone must have a little medical common sense, and certain senior doctors should not go about scaring people.” Another leader spoke, and continued, ”Human-to-human transmission is not possible; it can be prevented, treated and controlled.“ One day later, on January 17, Jiang Xueqing was hospitalized, and 10 days later he was intubated and put on ECMO. The toll at the central hospital is so large, and it’s connected to the lack of transparency for our medical staff. If you look at the people who fell ill, the emergency department and the respiratory department suffered less heavily, because we had a sense of the need for protection, and we knew we should quickly rest and get treatment as soon as we got sick. The worst cases are in the peripheral departments; Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist, and Jiang Xueqing is a nail specialist. Jiang Xueqing was really a very good person, with excellent medical skills. He held one of the two Chinese Physician Awards in the hospital. And yet we were neighbors, we were a unit; I’m located on the 40th floor, he was on the 30th floor, our working relationship was very good, but because I am too busy at work, I only met him during meetings and hospital activities. He was a workaholic, always either in the operating room or at the clinic. No one would go to tell him specifically, “Director Jiang, you have to pay attention and wear a mask”. He didn’t have the time and energy to inquire about these things, and he must have brushed it off with: “What’s the matter? It’s pneumonia.” This was what people in that department told me. If these doctors had been warned in time, perhaps this day wouldn’t have come. So that’s why, as one closely involved, I regret what I did. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn’t have cared about the reprimand, I would have [expletive] spoken of it everywhere, to everyone, wouldn’t I? Although I worked in the same hospital as Li Wenliang (李文亮) did before he died, I didn’t know him, because the hospital had over 4,000 people on staff and was usually busy. The night before his death, the director of the ICU called me to borrow a cardiac press (心脏按压器; CPR device?) from the emergency department, and said it was Li Wenliang who was going to be resuscitated. The news shocked me. I do not understand everything that happened to Li Wenliang, but could his condition have been affected by his emotional state after being reprimanded? I have to ask, with my experience; I felt it myself. Later, when things got to this point, it proved that Li Wenliang was right. I can understand his state of mind very easily. It could be my own. I don’t feel excitement or happiness, but regret. Regret that I didn’t continue to shout out loudly at the beginning, when people intervened and scolded us. I often find myself thinking, if only we could turn back time, and do it right. Just surviving is good On the night before the city was shut down on January 23, a friend from the relevant department called to ask me about the true situation of emergency patients in Wuhan. I said, are you asking in a private or public capacity? He said, private. [I said,] I will tell you the truth when I speak on my behalf: On January 21, our emergency department saw 1,523 patients, three times as many as usual, of which 655 had fever. The situation in the emergency department during that time will never be forgotten by those who experienced it, it completely changes your outlook on life. If this is a war, the emergency department is the front line. But at the time, the inpatient wards were saturated, and basically none of the patients were accepted, and the ICU was resolutely refused to accept them. They said that there were uninfected patients in them, and they became contaminated as soon as they entered. More patients kept rushing in to the emergency department, and the inpatient beds were not open, so they all piled up in the emergency department. Patients queued for a few hours to see a doctor. We couldn’t take any time off work at all. There was no distinction between the fever clinic and the emergency department. The hall was full of patients. The emergency room, the IV room, everywhere was filled with patients. Another patient’s family came in, wanting a bed for their dad, who couldn’t make it in from the car, because the underground garage was closed at the time, and the car couldn’t get in. I couldn’t do anything about that, but I ran to the car with people and equipment. I saw immediately that he was already dead. What can you say, it’s very difficult to bear. The man died in the car, he didn’t even get out of the car. There was also an old man, his wife had just died at Jinyintan Hospital, her son and daughter were infected, and she was given an IV, her son-in-law was caring for her. As soon as I saw that she was very ill, I contacted the respiratory department to admit her to the hospital. Her son-in-law was obviously a cultured person. He came over and wished to thank the doctor and so on. As a result, she died. It only took a few seconds, but it was a delay of a few seconds. That quick “thank you” weighs heavily on me. And yet there were many people who sent their families to the ward (监护室[; guardianship room]? in the sense of trustee), and that’s the last time you’l see them, you’ll never see them again. I remember when I came to work on the morning of the Chinese New Year [Friday, January 24, 2020]. I said that we’d take a picture to commemorate the New Year. I also sent it to a circle of friends. No one wished anyone a happy new year that day. At the time, just surviving was good. In the past, if you made a small mistake, for example, if you didn’t give an injection in time, the patient might still be in trouble. Now there’s no one, no one is to raise it with you, no-one is going to take issue with it. Everyone’s overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught, we work blindly. The patients died, and it was rare to see family members weeping and grieving, because there were too many, too many. Some family members didn’t say “Doctor, please save my family”, but said to the doctor, “Right, let’s do this quickly”; it came to that. Everyone was afraid of being infected. The queue at the fever clinic was 5 hours long, every day. A woman waiting in line collapsed, a woman in a leather coat, with a purse and high heels, very carefully dressed. A middle-aged woman; no one dared to step forward to help her, and she lay on the ground for a long time. I had to call the nurse and doctor to help her. On the morning of January 30, I came to work. The son of a white-haired old man had died at the age of 32. He stared blankly at the doctor giving him the death certificate. There are no tears at all, how can one cry? There’s no way to cry. From the style of his clothing, the old man might be a rural migrant worker, there’s no way to be sure. Without a diagnosis, his son became a death certificate. This is what I want to call for. The patients who died in the emergency department were all undiagnosed, and their causes of death could not be confirmed. After this epidemic has passed, I hope to give an explanation and give their families some comfort. Our patients wake compassion, a great deal of compassion. “Lucky” Having been a doctor for so many years, I always felt that no difficulty could overwhelm me, not with my experience and personality. When I was nine, my father died of gastric cancer. At that time, I thought of growing up to be a doctor, to save the lives of others. Later, when I did my the college entrance examination, all my preferences were in medicine, and I finally got to go to Tongji Medical College. After graduating from medical college in 1997, I went to the Central Hospital. I previously worked in cardiovascular medicine, and I became the director of the emergency department in 2010. I feel the emergency department is one of my children. I built it up, I nurtured a tight-knit group, which really doesn’t make this situation easier, but it’s what makes this group such a treasure; I really cherish this team. A few days ago, one of my nurses sent a message to a friends group saying “I really miss the old big busy emergency department”; that kind of busy and this kind of busy are totally different concepts. Before this epidemic hit, our emergency department dealt with myocardial infarctions, cerebral infarctions, gastrointestinal bleeding, trauma and so on. That kind of busy gives a sense of accomplishment, it has a clear purpose, there’s a smooth flow of procedures for all the various types of patients. There are very mature procedures, there’s not a single wasted step, what to do next is not a problem. But in this time there were so many critically ill patients whom we had no way to deal with and who couldn’t be admitted to hospital, and our medical staff was still at risk. This kind of busyness is desperate, it’s deeply distressing. One day at 8 in the morning, a young doctor in our department sent me a WeChat, and it was quite personal, saying they wouldn’t come to work that day, not well. Since what we do here, if someone is not well, they need to tell me about it in advance; if they tell me at 8 o’clock, where do I go to find someone? The doctor lost their temper with me in WeChat, and said that a large number of highly suspect cases were put back into the community by the emergency department I led. We understand that this is sin! I understand this person, because this is a doctor’s professional ethics, but I was also anxious, and I said you can denounce me, but tell me, what would you do if you were the director of the emergency department? Later, the doctor came back to work after a few days of rest. The doctor didn’t say that they feared death or feared harm; no, they were affected the conditions; suddenly having to deal with so many patients at once, they felt utterly overwhelmed. And the work of the medics, especially for the many medics who came to support us, it was psychologically unbearable. There were doctors and nurses in tears. Some were crying for others, others were crying for themselves, because no-one knows when it will be their turn to become infected. Around mid-to-late January, the hospital’s leaders also became ill, one after another, including our director of the office and three vice-presidents. The daughter of the Chief of Medical Services was also ill and resting at home. So basically there was no administration or management; you just had to fight there, that was the feeling. The people around me also started to come down with it one by one. On January 18, at 8:30 in the morning, our first doctor collapsed, saying “I caught it just like the director did”, no fever, did a CT first off, and the lungs had a lump of ground-glass opacification (坨磨玻璃). Not long after, the duty nurse in charge of the isolation ward told me they’d fallen ill. That night, our head nurse fell ill. My very real first feeling at that time was — good luck, because falling ill early, you could get off the battlefield for a little bit. I’ve been in close contact with these three people. I just work every day with the belief that I must fall ill. Everyone in the hospital thought I was a miracle. I’ve thought about it myself, perhaps it’s because I have asthma and I’m using some inhaled hormones, perhaps it inhibits the deposition of these viruses in the lungs. I’ve always felt that the people who work in the emergency department have feelings, too. In Chinese hospitals, the status of the emergency department is relatively low among the departments, because everyone thinks that the emergency department is nothing more than a route into the hospital, it just needs to admit patients. During this epidemic, this sort of neglect has always been present. In the early days, they’re weren’t enough supplies. Sometimes the quality of the protective clothing assigned to the emergency department was very poor. I was angry when I saw that our nurses wore such clothes to work and spoke up about it in Zhouhui Qun[a WeChat group for MDs in that hospital]. After that, many directors gave me all the protective clothing they kept in their departments. There were also problems with food. When there are many patients, the management gets confused. They simply can’t think that the emergency department still has to have something to eat. Many departments had food and drink after shift changeover, they had a big spread, and here, we had nothing. In the fever clinic’s WeChat group, doctors complained: “Our emergency department has only disposable diapers…” We were the front-line response, and we had to deal with that sort of thing, sometimes it made me really angry. Our team is really good. Everyone held the line, they were only off work when they were sick. More than 40 people in our emergency department were infected. I built a group of all the sick people, originally called the “Emergency Department Sick Group”(急诊生病群); the head nurse said that was unlucky, and changed it to “Emergency Department Re-energizing Group” (急诊加油群). Even the people who are sick weren’t thinking in terms of despair or blame. They were all very positive, that is, everyone had the attitude that we needed to help one another to get thorough the crisis together. These kids, these young people are very good, it’s just that they, like me, have to live with feeling slighted. I hope that after this epidemic, the country will also increase its investment in emergency departments. In many countries’ medical systems, the emergency department is highly valued. Unattainable happiness On February 17th, I received a WeChat message from the old classmate at Tongji Hospital. He said “Sorry” to me. I said: it’s fortunate that you passed the message on and warned some people in time. If he hadn’t passed it on, they might not have Li Wenliang and the eight others, but people would probably know less. This time, we had the entire families of three female doctors get infected. Two female doctors had their father-in-law and mother-in-law infected, and their husbands, and another had her father, mother, sister, and husband infected, and five close relatives. Everyone thinks that the virus was discovered so early on, and yet this is the result, it caused us such great loss, took such a terrible toll. It took this toll in many different ways, too. In addition to those who died, those who were sick also suffered. In our “Emergency Department Re-energizing group”, people often exchange physical conditions. Some people ask: a heart rate that’s always 120 beats per minute, does it matter? Surely it matters, they panic as soon as they move. This will affect them for life, and is heart failure likely? It’s hard to say. In the future, others will be able to go hiking and traveling, and they might not be able to, all that is possible. And Wuhan. You said that our Wuhan is a lively place; now it’s very, very quiet on the streets. Many things can’t be bought and we have to support the whole country. A few days ago, a nurse of a medical team in Guangxi suddenly fell into a coma while at work, and was resucitated. Her heart restarted, but she is still in a coma. If she hadn’t come to work, she could have had a good time at home, and this kind of thing wouldn’t have happened. So, I think we owe everyone, really. Having been through this epidemic, many people in the hospital have been hit hard. Several medical staff below me have thoughts of resignation, including some backbones of the department. Everyone’s previous ideas, all the things everyone knows about this profession, they’re are inevitably a little shaken — it’s that you work so hard, isn’t it? Just like Jiang Xueqing, he worked too hard, he was too good to the patients, he was doing surgery every year during [Chinese] New Year. Today, someone sent a WeChat written by Jiang Xueqing’s daughter, saying that her father’s time was all given to his patients. Myself, I’ve had countless thoughts of going back home to be a housewife. After the epidemic began, I basically didn’t go home, I lived separately from my husband. My sister helped take care of my children at home. My second treasure didn’t recognize me, didn’t react to me when he saw me on video. I felt very lost. It wasn’t easy for me to give birth to this second child. He was 10 kg at birth. I had to wean him abruptly — when I made that decision, that was hard for me to do. My husband told me that these things happen in life, and you’re not only a participant, you’re also choosing to lead the team to fight this epidemic; that’s also a very meaningful act, and when everything returns to normal for everyone, then you’ll remember; it’s a valuable experience to have had. The leader (领导) talked to me on the morning of February 21st. Actually, I would have liked to ask a few questions, such as, do you think that that criticism was wrong that day? I hoped to be given an apology. But I dared not ask. No one said sorry to me on any occasion. I still feel that these events are an even clearer demonstation of why each person should stick to their own independent ideas, regardless, because if someone wants to stand up and tell the truth, there must be someone, and the world must hear a dissenting voice, right? I’m Wuhanese, who doesn’t love their own city? Now we remember what extravagant happiness we enjoyed in the most ordinary life. I now feel that holding the baby, going out to play with him on a slide, or going out to watch a movie with my husband, which is common in the past, are a kind of happiness, unachievable happiness.

我說，你要急於用官司懲戒歹人還自己清白，我看就算了，我保證你睡不著覺掉頭髮心情低落……打官司，又碰上一幫依法辦事的人，是小概率事件。我們打官司，只是想碰碰運氣。從今天開始，方方，忘記你的官司，把它軟埋起來。 方方正在犯著另一個錯誤，向大家解釋那些人是在造謠……多麼徒勞的一件事。它們知道它們在造謠，它們也知道我們知道它們在造謠。它們就喜歡看你祥林嫂一樣，到處說，老子到處說，它們在造謠……我們關愛的芸芸眾生永遠也搞不清楚孰是孰非。 飯桌上，一老兄喝了兩口對我說：我就喜歡你主持的有一說一。我說對不起，我主持的是實話實說(操你大爺馮褲子)。那老兄又說，網上說你爺爺是漢奸，被武工隊抓住綁上石頭沉河裡了……是造謠吧? 我說，網上怎麼會造謠呢? 是真的，我爸也是。到了我這兒又當CCTV著名主持人又是全國政協委員，你說，這TM到哪兒去說理去? 給我也倒一杯，那什麼，你爺爺那哪部分的？ 好，現在我們講第二梯隊。成色複雜，僅我遇到的，就有北大張頤武、清華肖鷹、農大何柄生一類的教授，有眾多大學在校學生、有任職期間就開公司的解放軍某部退休副司令員、有開著僚機把長機撞下來的空軍前飛行員、有現任法官和檢察官、有騷氣十足的香港電視台娘們兒、有報社總編輯、有女交警、有科學家有紅二代官二代……他們共同的特徵是腦殘。分成兩撥兒，一撥兒是傻，一撥兒是壞。 不回憶了，每一仗都打得很慘烈！ 現在，這個豪華陣容要來對付你方方了，你能應付嗎？你願意為他們耗神耗力虛度年華嗎？ 第三課 By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-27 14:02:15 "},"chap01Chinese_Materials/网络暴力下的方方日记/崔永元日记一则2020年4月22日.html":{"url":"chap01Chinese_Materials/网络暴力下的方方日记/崔永元日记一则2020年4月22日.html","title":"崔永元日记2020年4月22日","keywords":"","body":"日记一则 一个是对过去侵略者泯灭人性的追忆，一个是对当代中国人追杀人性的纪实。 来源：twitter, 转自第三方网站；作者：崔永元; 原文地址 文化名城南京有一左笔书法，自称钱诗贵。前日勃发奇想，于南京建方方日记作者跪像一尊，供人观赏联想宋之秦桧。今日头条称人言沸腾响应者众。 …… 于是，他起身写作如下：如果南京建方方跪像我没意见。因为南京自此就拥有两处人性耻辱的标记，另一处是已经建成的南京大屠杀纪念馆。 这两个，一个是对过去侵略者泯灭人性的追忆，一个是对当代中国人追杀人性的纪实。 另，本人愿自费制作花岗岩个人跪像一尊，跪陪方方。请主办方恩准。 当夜十时收到微信，先是三个“哭哭哭”（表情），然后是： 跪谢哥，库内积压花岗岩已全部售磬，请速改跪像石材为大理石。 哥，卡号没变吧？ By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-27 14:02:15 "},"chap02English_Materials/":{"url":"chap02English_Materials/","title":"Disclaimer","keywords":"","body":" By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-27 14:02:15 "},"chap02English_Materials/Opposition_Faction/":{"url":"chap02English_Materials/Opposition_Faction/","title":"Opposition Faction","keywords":"","body":" By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-27 14:02:15 "},"chap02English_Materials/Opposition_Faction/Chinas_Chernobyl_moment.html":{"url":"chap02English_Materials/Opposition_Faction/Chinas_Chernobyl_moment.html","title":"China Chernobyl Moment","keywords":"","body":"Coronavirus coverup is ‘China's Chernobyl moment,’ warn 100 politicians, experts Source: GlobalNews, by Amanda Connolly, Posted April 14, 2020 ; Address Trying to cover up the coronavirus pandemic marks China‘s “Chernobyl moment,” according to a new Open Letter. More than 100 international politicians and international policy experts have signed on to the letter, including former Canadian justice minister and human rights advocate Irwin Cotler. In it, the signatories warn that the coronavirus crisis shows it is more important than ever to raise up and listen to independent voices in China given the regime’s silencing of experts who tried to raise alarm bells. “China’s Chernobyl moment is a self-inflicted wound,” the letter states. “The CCP [Communist Party of China] silenced Chinese doctors who wanted to warn other health professionals during the early stage of the outbreak.” It goes on to criticize the World Health Organization for bowing to Chinese pressure to downplay the severity of the situation. That’s a criticism that the organization has been facing now for months. There have been repeated intelligence leaks in recent weeks casting doubt on the official case numbers of the novel coronavirus reported by China to the World Health Organization. Bloomberg first reported on April 1 that the American intelligence community concluded in a classified report for the Trump administration that China’s reporting on coronavirus cases and deaths was faked. That report cited three U.S. intelligence officials calling the data from China “intentionally incomplete.” The following day, the New York Times reported that the CIA had been warning the American administration since early February that China’s coronavirus tallies could not be trusted. The intelligence officials cited in that report said a likely cause was that health officials in Wuhan, China had been hiding the real numbers out of fear of losing their jobs. In the open letter, the experts say that in that coverup lies “the roots of the pandemic.” They urge people around the world to confront “an inconvenient truth” about China. “By politicizing all aspects of life including people’s health, continued autocratic one-party rule in the People’s Republic of China has endangered everyone,” they write, suggesting that the intentions of the Communist Party of China can no longer be trusted. “We should pay greater attention to the voices of what can be termed ‘unofficial’ China. These independent-minded academics, doctors, entrepreneurs, citizen journalists, public interest lawyers and young students no longer accept the CCP’s rule by fear. Neither should you.” Other signatories to the letter include U.K. MP Damian Collins, who chaired the international grand committee examining privacy and social media misinformation last year, along with members of Parliament from Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, the European Parliament and the U.K. There are also several former ministers of foreign affairs, defence and home affairs, along with a broad range of civil society advocates and academics, including Canadian writer Jonathan Manthorpe. No Canadian members of Parliament from any party signed the letter. Canadian Health Minister Patty Hajdu earlier this month attacked a journalist who asked about whether China’s data can be trusted, criticizing them as “feeding conspiracy theories.” By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-27 14:02:15 "},"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/":{"url":"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/","title":"The Moderates","keywords":"","body":" By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-27 14:02:15 "},"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/The_World_After_Coronavirus.html":{"url":"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/The_World_After_Coronavirus.html","title":"The World After Coronavirus","keywords":"","body":"The World After Coronavirus Source: Financial Times, by Yuval Noah Harari March 20 2020; Address One comment which is liked by most totally says what I want to say to this Article.
