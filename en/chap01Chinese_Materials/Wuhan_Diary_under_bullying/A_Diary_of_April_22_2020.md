There is a left hand manuscript of calligraphy in Nanjing, the renowned city of culture, whose writer calls himself Qian Shigui. He was seized by a whim the day before yesterday to propose that there should be a kneeling statue of Fangfang, who is the author of the Wuhan Diary, for people to visit and spit on just like everyone has been doing to the statue of Qin Hui of the Song Dynasty (for treason). "The proposal has received much support and the repercussions of it continue to be more and more furious", say some media.

......

Then I start to write as below:

I have nothing more to say for this proposal than that there could be two symbolic marks of the stigmatisation of humanity  in Nanjing. One will be the statue of Fangfang, the other is The Memorial Hall of the Victims of  the Nanjing Massacre (by Japanese invaders).

The latter is for reflecting what the invaders did to obliterate humanity, the former will be a reminder of how the contemporary Chinese people have hunted down the author of the diary.

In addition, I would like to get a kneeling statue of myself, at my own expense, to accompany Fangfang's statue. I plead with the organizers to be allowed to do so.

I receive three messages on Wechat at 10:00 pm at night. The first is three crying emojis, the next:

Thanks bro very much, there is no granite in stock, please change the material of the kneeling statue to marble.

The last: Bro, have you altered your line?
