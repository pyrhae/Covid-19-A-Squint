{"./":{"url":"./","title":"Initial page","keywords":"","body":"Initial page On 23rd January 2020, news about the Wuhan lockdown spread on the internet. At that time, I was at home, in rural Hunan, shocked by this news and other related news. Today, the 22nd April 2020, this disaster is still unfolding. I begin to record these events, considering them to be a turning point in China's history and also a milestone in modern human history. What should we believe? Is the slight murmuring which is turning up and lingering in the crannies of web platforms something to listen? Them are covered up by the Chinese style political correctness、through information blockouts and misleading the public. Finally, different opinions of different political stands and different requests of different groups, are totally suppressed by one loud voice. People are indifferent and unconcerned about politics, for they are scared by politics. Yet politics, if malicious, will always reappear in different forms of oppression and exploitation. What should we expect? Will it be a century or longer of suffering manipulation and deception by a dictatorial government which derives from several thousand years of feudalism. Does this ancient race still have a future? The events of this virus, in reality are a post-modern inquiry for humankind. More and More high level technologies were introduced in confronting the virus, which have placed freedom in danger. Globalization has become a joke, so has the conception of a common destiny for all mankind. The chasm between the dictatorial world and the free world has torn the flattering face of capitalism into pieces. Humankind is oblivious to history, every generation comes from the nil and the ignorant. Perhaps this event is just another SARS event or Tiananmen event, and Chinese almost know nothing about it and humankind pretend they almost know nothing about it. There is no hope for this country, so long as what have been stated and showed here is still not permitted spreading freely. Here, what I record, what I think, all base on the stand of anti-dictatorship. I want to record how this Leviathan stepping into decay in this year, though the going-down had began in 2019, 2020 is worthier of recording. In this year the virus came from the unknown other place, owing to the globalization and Capitalism, under the cover of dictatorship of China, have been rampaging all of the world. Those empty cities, those deadly quiet streets, depict to us some kind of Doomsday. Some said, the earth is a cliff, and civilization is a two-hundred-years train. \"The world is getting worse and worse, which cannot be pulled back, just like a train rushing towards cliff, fall down from head to foot. And the train is the delta of 200 years of falling.\" If this should be true, I wish the contemporaries and the next generations would never forget it. In the 200 years of humankind's group memory, in the 200 years of civilization, may people remember for who the death bell rings. Civilizations have been taking a long long time to get into this level, however, the destroy of it only costs a second. 2020年1月23日，武汉封城的消息正在网上传播。那时，我在家里，湖南农村地区，被这个新闻和其他相关新闻震惊到了。 今天，2020年4月22日，灾难仍然在持续。我开始记录这些事，将它们视为中国历史上的一个转折点、人类现代史上的里程碑。 我们能相信什么呢？是社交网络平台上那些在夹缝中苟延残喘的微弱的呼救吗？它们随后被中国式的“政治正确”、信息封锁、混淆视听掩盖了。不同的政治声音，不同人群的诉求，最终被一个嘈杂的声音取缔了。人们不关心政治，因为他们害怕政治；但政治最终会以不同形式的压榨与剥削回到那些浑浑噩噩的人群中去。 我们能期望什么呢？是数千年封建帝制后更为残酷的独裁政权一个世纪甚至更长时间的愚弄与操纵吗？这个古老而腐朽的民族，它有未来吗？这次的病毒事件，它无疑更是对人类的后现代式拷问。更多的先进与高端技术被投入与病毒的对抗中，人们的自由可能进一步受到钳制；全球化成为一个笑话，“人类命运共同体”成为一个笑话。自由世界与独裁世界的鸿沟将资本主义的谄媚嘴脸撕得粉碎。 人类是健忘的，每一代人都从懵懂无知中走过来。也许这次事件不过是另一次SARS事件，或者另一次天安门事件。中国人对此几乎一无所知，人类假装对此几乎一无所知。 只要还有一天，这里所呈现的内容没有自由传播的可能，这个国家就没有希望可言。在此，我所记录的，我所思考的，都基于反独裁的立场。我希望记录这一年里这个利维坦如何走向衰落。尽管2019年衰落已经开始，但是2020年是更值得记录的一年。病毒来自晦暗不明的他处，借全球化与资本主义的便利，在独裁政权的护佑下屠戮四方；那些空荡荡的都市，那些死寂的街道，向我们诠释了某种末日情景。 有人说，世界是一个悬崖，文明是二百年的火车。“世界会越来越坏，这一点无法控制，比如一趟火车冲入悬崖，也是从头到尾顺序掉落，这趟火车就是二百年时光。” 如果这是真的，我希望至少二百年内，当代人与其后的几代人记住这次灾难。在人类群体记忆的两百年内，在文明的二百年内，希望人们不要忘记丧钟为何而鸣。文明发展到今天，它的毁灭真的只需要一点时间而已。 个人整理的粗略时间线： Date Events References 03.17 中国驱逐美国记者 NewYorkTimes, China Announces That It Will Expel American Journalists 04.14 Trump暂停了给WHO的资金 GlobalNews, Trump orders U.S. to halt funding to WHO over coronavirus response 武汉惊现大字报 威胁方方以死谢罪 武汉街头惊现威胁方方大字报：要求“削发为尼或以死谢罪” 04.16 数字货币将在苏州相城区落地 央行数字货币应用将在苏州相城区落地 In May China’s digital currency to be used for transport payments in Suzhou 04.17 武汉官方称病毒的死亡人数突增1290 GlobalNews,Wuhan adds 1,290 coronavirus deaths to its total count, citing overwhelmed hospitals 04.18 香港警方上门拘捕多名泛民人士 中国数字时代，香港警方上门拘捕多名泛民人士 -[In May China’s digital currency to be used for transport payments in Suzhou](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/china-digital-currency-transport-payments-in-suzhou/)| |04.17 |武汉官方称病毒的死亡人数突增1290|-[GlobalNews,Wuhan adds 1,290 coronavirus deaths to its total count, citing overwhelmed hospitals](https://globalnews.ca/news/6831122/coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-up/)| |04.18 |香港警方上门拘捕多名泛民人士| -[中国数字时代，香港警方上门拘捕多名泛民人士](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/2020/04/%e5%be%b7%e5%9b%bd%e4%b9%8b%e5%a3%b0%ef%bd%9c%e9%a6%99%e6%b8%af%e8%ad%a6%e6%96%b9%e4%b8%8a%e9%97%a8%e6%8b%98%e6%8d%95%e5%a4%9a%e5%90%8d%e6%b3%9b%e6%b0%91%e4%ba%ba%e5%a3%ab/) --> By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-24 21:38:17 "},"video_infos.html":{"url":"video_infos.html","title":"Informations from videos","keywords":"","body":"This page used for collecting informations about covid-19 from videos, in the form of links and short comments.

一位援鄂医生，讲述了她在武汉一家医院工作41天平安归来之后，接受高规格待遇的受之有愧…… 由于某些原因，本文不具名址，亦不配医生图片。 下文讲述｜吐真言的医生 整理｜晓子君 （1） 医院发出通知那天，我在休假。 主任在科室群里说，医院援助武汉有8个名额，分到咱们科室有两个。 我没有回复。二宝还不到一岁，还不会叫妈妈，老公刚刚做了一个小手术在休养，家里的事，里外都需要我忙，说实话，看到主任的通知，我第一反应是：我不主动报名，但如果组织需要我，点了将，我会无条件前往武汉。 有两个同事很快回复，主动请战。 其中，有一个同事是聘用合同工，她希望能有更好发展，主动请战不难理解。另一个同事和我的情况差不多。 挺惭愧的，纠结要不要主动报名时，主任来电话了，征求我意见。电话里，他强调了我业务能力强。 我没有犹豫，表示会克服一切困难，前往武汉。 我写下请战书，签下生死状，和医院另几名同事一起，前往省城，跟来自全省内各地医院的同行集结，坐飞机前往武汉。 （2） 我是第一批援鄂医务人员，被分配到武汉市一家医院参与新冠肺炎的救治工作。 情况，比我想像中要严重很多。那些场面，就像打仗。不想过多描述疫情暴发高峰期，病人一床难求，以及临死前的凄惨。有一个事实是，一些媒体高调宣扬医务人员防护装备严重不足，只是个别医院存在的现象。我所在的医院，医务人员的防护设备，是齐全且充足的。 相反，我注意到，那些和我们在一线，从事清洁工作的工人，防护设备，还没有我们的好。仅我所在的那家医院，因为防护不到位而感染新冠肺炎的清洁工，就有好几个。 有一个清洁大妈，在我值晚班时，来到我的临时办公室，给了我一包方便面，然后怯声问我，你们用的那种防护品，我能不能买到几套？ 她解释，她是一个公司临时招来的，被分到医院的重症区做清洁工，公司统一配发了防护设备，她担心口罩和护手套等反复使用会增加感染机率，想备一些专用的防护品。 我送给她几个口罩和几双手套。 交流中，得知她是滞留在武汉的外地人，因为封城回不了家，她和丈夫看到有公司招临时工，分配到医院做清洁工，每天有600元报酬时，就报了名，夫妻俩分别被分配到两家医院上班，专门负责医院的垃圾清运。 （3） 身为医务人员，在一线和感染者打交道，你们从新闻上看到我们工作时的苦和累，都是真实的。因为穿着厚厚的防护服，我们长时间不能上洗手间，生理期血尿混和一起，也是真实的。长时间戴着口罩，脸上勒出血痕，也是真实的。 清洁大妈们，累了，就蹲在医院过道的角落睡觉，也是真实的。 他们没有厚厚的防护服，活动的范围却在重病感染区，也是真实的。 他们没有住高档酒店的待遇，也是真实的。 那些天，打开手机，满屏都是对医务人员的至高称赞，但媒体对那些干着最脏的活，冒着同样风险的底层人，鲜有报道。甚至，他们承担的感染风险，比医生更高，因为他们不是医生专业，没有医生更懂得如何自我保护。 说句心里话，我很失望。 我想起我的同行，写的一首诗，很有感触： 请不要给我花环，不要给我掌声 也不要什么工伤、烈士，几等功 来武汉，我不是来欣赏樱花的 也不是来风花雪夜、接受吹捧 只想疫情结束能安全回家…… 如果可以，请你们去看看 那些灭顶的家门，是否升起了炊烟 （4） 在武汉期间，很多故事，令我感动。 我们住的酒店，离医院虽然不远，但我们来的最初那些天，是没有通勤车的。令我们感动的是，有一天下班后，有武汉志愿者在医院门口等我们，车上写着标语：接白衣战士专用车。 那一刻，我感动得流下了眼泪！后来才知道，这些人，都是自发组织，免费接送我们上下班的。 还有人免费给我们送餐，甚至我们都不知道他们的名字。 同事和我说，武汉人懂得感恩。 我认为，我看到的清洁工，志愿者，还有运尸人，这些我们叫不出名字的人，这些和我们一样，决战疫情的人，他们的付出，不是为了让我们感恩的。 就如我来武汉，并不是，为了让武汉人感恩于我。我只不过是，在执行岗位职责。相比之下，那些冒着风雪，凌晨还奔波在武汉空冷的大街上的志愿者们，那些拿命博一份收入的清洁工、运尸人，他们干的却是额外的工作，他们何尝又不是在为武汉拼命？ （5） 在武汉工作了41天，我们第一批援鄂医务人员，踏上归途。 大巴从酒店驶出来，武汉交警以“最高礼遇、最深敬意、最佳形象”护航我们返程。 路边，群众挥手致敬。 场面真的好感人。一车的人，都哭得稀里哗拉。 回到家乡，刚下飞机，家乡的交警同样以“最高礼遇、最深敬意、最佳形象”护航我们回家。 路边，群众挥手致敬。 场面一样的感人，大家一样哭得稀里哗拉。 我也哭了。 武汉人民十里相送，家乡人民夹道欢迎。抗疫期间待遇提高二倍，全国多地景区免费让我们游玩，部分酒店免费让我们入住，而且，还被称之为“英雄”，我很欣慰我是一名医务人员，得到了应该得到的尊重与厚爱。 （6） 在家乡酒店隔离期间，情绪慢慢平复下来后，不知怎么的，我的脑海里，反复浮现出，我在武汉经历的那些人，那些事。 那些清洁工们，回家了吗？他们的归途，又是怎样的一番景象？ 那些无偿接我们上下班、为我们提供免费餐的志愿者们，他们回家了吗？他们的归途，又是怎样的一番景象？ 那些在白天和黑夜，忙着搬运遗体的运尸人，他们回家了吗？他们的归途，又是怎样的一番景象？ 我翻出那个问我要防护品的大妈微信，问她回家乡了没。 她说，还没回，年前来武汉，就是来为老公看病的，没想到遇到疫情困了这么多天，等几天带老公看病住院。 她跟我说了个事，公司结算时，只按200元一天给她算工资，并不是招聘时承诺的600元一天结算。 我的心堵得难受。想想，真是悲愤！我们医务人员，援鄂归来，是临时工的，马上解决编制，那个清洁大妈，却连承诺的工钱，都被黑掉一大半！ （7） 在媒体的聚光灯下，我是战疫英雄。 在媒体人的笔下，我不计报酬，我不论生死。 我，一名医务人员，因为恪尽职守，被宣扬“悲壮出征”。媒体聚焦下，我成了光环人物。 真的想说声抱歉。 这份荣光，我受之有愧！ 医生拿命救武汉，因感染壮烈在岗位上，被评为烈士，值得表彰。但有多少非医务人，每天都在重症区域清理卫生，每天都在无偿为我们提供暖心服务，每天都和感染治疗无效死亡的遗体零接触，他们当中，有多少人感染了新冠肺炎，又有多少人因为感染而去世？ 这是没有数据的。即便有数据，也是绝不会被评为烈士，受到表彰的。 真的想说声抱歉。 这份荣光，我受之有愧！ 我们在灾难中冲锋在前，人们选择性地忘记我们本来就是从事这个职业，就如，消防战士在灾难中冲锋在前，拿命守护岁月静好。 是不是，欠了那些消防人员救火归来的十里相送、夹道欢迎？ 是不是，欠了那些默默无闻的清洁工归来的十里相送、夹道欢迎？ 是不是，欠了那些不留名不为名的志愿者们归来的十里相送、夹道欢迎？ 如果压根不欠，那么，我凭什么要享受这样的荣光？凭什么接受如此礼遇还能自豪？ （8） 我想说。 我确实为武汉拼过命，我曾8小时没上洗手间，5小时没喝一口水，也曾昏倒过，至今因为戴口罩脸上还有印痕，配得上高规格的欢送和迎接，配得上鲜花和掌声，配得上组织上的表彰。 但我必须强调一个事实：我是一名医务工作者，我的职责就是治病救人，就如消防员的职责就是救火救人。 疫情已经控制住了，武汉，已经迎来了曙光，那些清洁工、运尸人、志愿者们，回家的回家，留下来的还在继续战斗，可是，谁会关注他们的命运？谁又在意着他们？ 他们，就像一粒粒尘埃，淹没在“十里相送、夹道欢迎”的光环之下。但在我看来，他们才是最有资格得到表彰的人！ 谢谢媒体对我的尊敬和赞赏，谢谢组织对我的厚爱。 我希望，媒体能够把镜头，对准那些在灾难中为了拯救一个个生命，而默默付出的人。他们的职业并不是医生，但他们面对的危险程度并不亚于我们，甚至因为非专业，比我们更危险。 我希望，祖国在为医务人员奋战疫情考虑各种福利的同时，也能想到成千上万个清洁大妈，我以为，他们，不应该被遗忘。 这就是我想说的真话。也是心里话。我不希望听到谁叫我英雄，那些同样为武汉拼过命的底层人，被忽视之，所以，我认为，英雄的称谓，让我受之有愧！ 以上所有，仅代表我个人的观点，不代表同行的观点和立场。 最后，谢谢接送过我上下班的志愿者，谢谢那个给过我一包方便面的清洁大妈，你们温暖过我，也温暖过，这个世界。 By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布

此前的一些报道，艾芬被称为「又一个被训诫的女医生浮出水面」，也有人将她称为「吹哨人」，艾芬纠正了 这个说法，她说自己不是吹哨人，是那个「发哨子的人」。 这是《人物》3月刊封面《武汉医生》的第二篇报道。 接到武汉市中心医院急诊科主任艾芬同意采访的短信是3月1日凌晨5点，大约半小时后，3月1日凌晨5点32分，她的同事、甲状腺乳腺外科主任江学庆因感染新冠肺炎去世。两天后，该院眼科副主任梅仲明过世，他和李文亮是同一科室。 截止2020年3月9日，武汉市中心医院已有4位医护人员因感染新冠肺炎去世——疫情发生以来，这家离华南海鲜市场只几公里的医院成为了武汉市职工感染人数最多的医院之一，据媒体报道医院超过200人被感染，其中包括三个副院长和多名职能部门主任，多个科室主任目前正在用ECMO维持。 死亡的阴影笼罩着这家武汉市最大的三甲医院，有医生告诉《人物》，在医院的大群里，几乎没有人说话，只在私下默默悼念、讨论。 悲剧原本有机会避免。2019年12月30日，艾芬曾拿到过一份不明肺炎病人的病毒检测报告，她用红色圈出「SARS冠状病毒」字样，当大学同学问起时，她将这份报告拍下来传给了这位同是医生的同学。当晚，这份报告传遍了武汉的医生圈，转发这份报告的人就包括那8位被警方训诫的医生。 这给艾芬带来了麻烦，作为传播的源头，她被医院纪委约谈，遭受了「前所未有的、严厉的斥责」，称她是作为专业人士在造谣。 3月2日下午，艾芬在武汉市中心医院南京路院区接受了《人物》的专访。她一个人坐在急诊室办公室中，曾经一天接诊超过1500位患者的急诊科此时已恢复了安静，急诊大厅里只躺着一名流浪汉。 此前的一些报道，艾芬被称为「又一个被训诫的女医生浮出水面」，也有人将她称为「吹哨人」，艾芬纠正了这个说法，她说自己不是吹哨人，是那个「发哨子的人」。采访中，艾芬数次提起「后悔」这个词，她后悔当初被约谈后没有继续吹响哨声，特别是对于过世的同事，「早知道有今天，我管他批评不批评，『老子』到处说，是不是？」 关于武汉市中心医院和艾芬本人在过去的两个多月中到底经历了什么？以下，是艾芬的讲述—— 前所未有的训斥 去年12月16日，我们南京路院区急诊科接诊了一位病人。莫名其妙高烧，一直用药都不好，体温动都不动一下。22号就转到了呼吸科，做了纤维支气管镜取了肺泡灌洗液，送去外面做高通量测序，后来口头报出来是冠状病毒。当时，具体管床的同事在我耳边嚼了几遍：艾主任，那个人报的是冠状病毒。后来我们才知道那个病人是在华南海鲜做事的。 紧接着12月27日，南京路院区又来了一个病人，是我们科一位医生的侄儿，40多岁，没有任何基础疾病，肺部一塌糊涂，血氧饱和只有90%，在下面其他医院已经治疗了将近10天左右都没有任何好转，病人收到了呼吸科监护室住院。同样做了纤维支气管镜取了肺泡灌洗液送去检测。 12月30日那天中午，我在同济医院工作的同学发了一张微信对话截图给我，截图上写着：「最近不要去华南啊，那里蛮多人高烧……」他问我是不是真的，当时，我正在电脑上看一个很典型的肺部感染患者的CT，我就把CT录了一段11秒钟的视频传给他，告诉他这是上午来我们急诊的一个病人，也是华南海鲜市场的。 当天下午4点刚过，同事给我看了一份报告，上面写的是：SARS冠状病毒、绿脓假单胞菌、46种口腔/呼吸道定植菌。我仔细看了很多遍报告，下面的注释写着：SARS冠状病毒是一种单股正链RNA病毒。该病毒主要传播方式为近距离飞沫传播或接触患者呼吸道分泌物，可引起的一种具有明显传染性，可累及多个脏器系统的特殊肺炎，也称非典型肺炎。 当时，我吓出了一身冷汗，这是一个很可怕的东西。病人收在呼吸科，按道理应该呼吸科上报这个情况，但是为了保险和重视起见，我还是立刻打电话上报给了医院公共卫生科和院感科。当时我们医院呼吸科主任正好从我门口过，他是参加过非典的人，我把他抓住，说，我们有个病人收到你们科室，发现了这个东西。他当时一看就说，那就麻烦了。我就知道这个事情麻烦了。 给医院打完电话，我也给我同学传了这份报告，特意在「SARS冠状病毒、绿脓假单胞菌、46种口腔/呼吸道定植菌」这一排字上画了个红圈，目的是提醒他注意、重视。我也把报告发在了科室医生群里面，提醒大家注意防范。 当天晚上，这个东西就传遍了，各处传的截屏都是我画红圈的那个照片，包括后来知道李文亮传在群里的也是那份。我心里当时就想可能坏事儿了。10点20，医院发来了信息，是转市卫健委的通知，大意就是关于不明原因肺炎，不要随意对外发布，避免引起群众恐慌，如果因为信息泄露引发恐慌，要追责。 我当时心里就很害怕，立刻把这条信息转给了我同学。过了大概一个小时，医院又来了一份通知，再次强调群内的相关消息不能外传。一天后，1月1日晚上11点46分，医院监察科科长给我发了条消息，让我第二天早上过去一下。 那一晚上我都没有睡着，很担忧，翻来覆去地想，但又觉得凡事总有两面性，即便造成不良影响，但提醒武汉的医务人员注意防范也不一定是个坏事。第二天早上8点多一点，还没有等我交完班，催我过去的电话就打来了。 之后的约谈，我遭受了前所未有的、非常严厉的斥责。 当时，谈话的领导说，「我们出去开会都抬不起头，某某某主任批评我们医院那个艾芬，作为武汉市中心医院急诊科主任，你是专业人士，怎么能够没有原则没有组织纪律造谣生事？」这是原话。让我回去跟科室的200多号人一个个地口头传达到位，不能发微信、短信传达，只能当面聊或者打电话，不许说关于这个肺炎的任何事情，「连自己的老公都不能说」…… 我整个人一下子就懵了，他不是批评你这个人工作不努力，而是好像整个武汉市发展的大好局面被我一个人破坏了。我当时有一种很绝望的感觉，我是一个平时认认真真、勤勤恳恳工作的人，我觉得自己做的事情都是按规矩来的，都是有道理的，我犯了什么错？我看到了这个报告，我也上报医院了，我和我的同学，同行之间对于某一个病人的情况进行交流，没有透露病人的任何私人信息，就相当于是医学生之间讨论一个病案，当你作为一个临床的医生，已经知道在病人身上发现了一种很重要的病毒，别的医生问起，你怎么可能不说呢？这是你当医生的本能，对不对？我做错什么了？我做了一个医生、一个人正常应该做的事情，换作是任何人我觉得都会这么做。 我当时的情绪也很激动，说，这个事是我做的，跟其余人都没有关系，你们干脆把我抓去坐牢吧。我说我现在这个状态不适合在这个岗位上继续工作了，想要休息一段时间。领导没有同意，说这个时候正是考验我的时候。 当天晚上回家，我记得蛮清楚，进门后就跟我老公讲，我要是出了什么事情，你就好好地把孩子带大。因为我的二宝还很小，才1岁多。他当时觉得莫名其妙，我没有跟他说自己被训话的事，1月20号，钟南山说了人传人之后，我才跟他说那天发生了什么。那期间，我只是提醒家人不要去人多的地方，出门要戴口罩。 外围科室 很多人担心我也是那8个人之一被叫去训诫。实际上我没有被公安局训诫，后来有好朋友问我，你是不是吹哨人？我说我不是吹哨人，我是那个发哨子的人。 但那次约谈对我的打击很大，非常大。回来后我感觉整个人心都垮了，真的是强打着精神，认真做事，后来所有的人再来问我，我就不能回答了。 我能做的就是先让急诊科重视防护。我们急诊科200多人，从1月1号开始，我就叫大家加强防护，所有的人必须戴口罩、戴帽子、用手快消。记得有一天交班有个男护士没戴口罩，我马上就当场骂他「以后不戴口罩就不要来上班了」。 1月9号，我下班时看见预检台一个病人对着大家咳，从那天后，我就要求他们必须给来看病的病人发口罩，一人发一个，这个时候不要节约钱，当时外面在说没有人传人，我又要在这里强调戴口罩加强防护，都是很矛盾的。 那段时间确实很压抑，非常痛苦。有医生提出来要把隔离衣穿外头，医院里开会说不让，说隔离衣穿外头会造成恐慌。我就让科室的人把隔离服穿白大褂里面，这是不符合规范的，很荒谬的。 我们眼睁睁地看着病人越来越多，传播区域的半径越来越大，先是华南海鲜市场附近可能跟它有关系，然后就传传传，半径越来越大。很多是家庭传染的，最先的7个人当中就有妈妈给儿子送饭得的病。有诊所的老板得病，也是来打针的病人传给他的，都是重得不得了。我就知道肯定有人传人。如果没有人传人，华南海鲜市场1月1日就关闭了，怎么病人会越来越多呢？ 很多时候我都在想，如果他们当时不那样训斥我，心平气和地问一下这件事情的来龙去脉，再请别的呼吸科专家一起沟通一下，也许局面会好一些，我至少可以在医院内部多交流一下。如果是1月1号大家都这样引起警惕，就不会有那么多悲剧了。 1月3号下午，在南京路院区，泌尿外科的医生们聚集在一起回顾老主任的工作历程，参会的胡卫峰医生今年43岁，现在正在抢救；1月8号下午，南京路院区22楼，江学庆主任还组织了武汉市甲乳患者康复联欢会；1月11号早上，科室跟我汇报急诊科抢救室护士胡紫薇感染，她应该是中心医院第一个被感染的护士，我第一时间给医务科科长打电话汇报，然后医院紧急开了会，会上指示把「两下肺感染，病毒性肺炎？」的报告改成「两肺散在感染」；1月16号最后一次周会上，一位副院长还在说：「大家都要有一点医学常识，某些高年资的医生不要自己把自己搞得吓死人的。」另一位领导上台继续说：「没有人传人，可防可治可控。」一天后，1月17号，江学庆住院，10天后插管、上ECMO。 中心医院的代价这么大，就是跟我们的医务人员没有信息透明化有关。你看倒下的人，急诊科和呼吸科的倒是没有那么重的，因为我们有防护意识，并且一生病就赶紧休息治疗。重的都是外围科室，李文亮是眼科的，江学庆是甲乳科的。 江学庆真的非常好的一个人，医术很高，全院的两个中国医师奖之一。而且我们还是邻居，我们一个单元，我住四十几楼，他住三十几楼，关系都很好，但是平时因为工作太忙，就只能开会、搞医院活动时候见见面。他是个工作狂，要么就在手术室，要么就在看门诊。谁也不会特意跑去跟他说，江主任，你要注意，戴口罩。他也没有时间和精力打听这些事，他肯定就大意了：「有什么关系？就是个肺炎。」这个是他们科室的人告诉我的。 如果这些医生都能够得到及时的提醒，或许就不会有这一天。所以，作为当事人的我非常后悔，早知道有今天，我管他批评不批评我，「老子」到处说，是不是？ 虽然和李文亮同在一个医院，一直到去世之前我都不认得他，因为医院4000多号人太多了，平时也忙。他去世前的那天晚上，ICU的主任跟我打电话借急诊科的心脏按压器，说李文亮要抢救，我一听这个消息大吃一惊，李文亮这个事整个过程我不了解，但是他的病情跟他受训斥之后心情不好有没有关系？这我要打个问号，因为受训的感觉我感同身受。 后来，事情发展到这一步，证明李文亮是对的时候，他的心情我非常能理解，可能跟我的心情一样，不是激动、高兴，而是后悔，后悔当初就应该继续大声疾呼，应该在所有的人问我们的时候，继续说。很多很多次我都在想，如果时间能够倒回来该多好。 活着就是好的 在1月23日封城前一天的晚上，有相关部门的朋友打电话问我武汉市急诊病人的真实情况。我说你代表私人，还是代表公家。他说我代表私人。我说代表个人就告诉你真话，1月21号，我们急诊科接诊1523个病人，是往常最多时的3倍，其中发烧的有655个人。 那段时间急诊科的状况，经历过的人一辈子都忘不了，甚至会颠覆你的所有人生观。 如果说这是打仗，急诊科就在最前线。但当时的情况是，后面的病区已经饱和了，基本上一个病人都不收，ICU也坚决不收，说里面有干净的病人，一进去就污染了。病人不断地往急诊科涌，后面的路又不通，就全部堆在急诊科。病人来看病，一排队随便就是几个小时，我们也完全没法下班，发热门诊和急诊也都不分了，大厅里堆满了病人，抢救室输液室里到处都是病人。 还有的病人家属来了，说要一张床，我的爸爸在汽车里面不行了，因为那时候地下车库已封，他车子也堵着开不进来。我没办法，带着人和设备跑去汽车里去，一看，人已经死了，你说是什么感受，很难受很难受。这个人就死在汽车里，连下车的机会都没有。 还有一位老人，老伴刚在金银潭医院去世了，她的儿子、女儿都被感染了，在打针，照顾她的是女婿，一来我看她病得非常重，联系呼吸科给收进去住院，她女婿一看就是个有文化有素质的人，过来跟我说谢谢医生等等的，我心里一紧，说快去，根本耽误不了了。结果送去就去世了。一句谢谢虽然几秒钟，但也耽误了几秒。这句谢谢压得我很沉重。 还有很多人把自己的家人送到监护室的时候，就是他们见的最后一面，你永远见不着了。 我记得大年三十的早上我来交班，我说我们来照个相，纪念一下这个大年三十，还发了个朋友圈。那天，大家都没有说什么祝福，这种时候，活着就是好的。 以前，你如果有一点失误，比如没有及时打针，病人都可能还去闹，现在没人了，没有人跟你吵，没有人跟你闹了，所有人都被这种突然来的打击击垮了，搞蒙了。 病人死了，很少看到家属有很伤心地哭的，因为太多了，太多了。有些家属也不会说医生求求你救救我的家人，而是跟医生说，唉，那就快点解脱吧，已经到了这个地步。因为这时候每个人怕的都是自己被感染。 一天发热门诊门口的排队，要排5个小时。正排着一个女的倒下了，看她穿着皮衣，背着包包，穿着高跟鞋，应该是很讲究的一个中年女性，可是没有人敢上前去扶她，就在地上躺了很久。只得我去喊护士、医生来去扶她。 1月30号我早上来上班，一个白发老人的儿子32岁死了，他就盯着看医生给他开死亡证明。根本没有眼泪，怎么哭？没办法哭。看他的打扮，可能就是一个外来的打工的，没有任何渠道去反映。没有确诊，他的儿子，就变成了一张死亡证明。 这也是我想要去呼吁一下的。在急诊科死亡的病人都是没有诊断、没办法确诊的病例，等这个疫情过去之后，我希望能给他们一个交代，给他们的家庭一些安抚，我们的病人很可怜的，很可怜。 「幸运」 做了这么多年医生，我一直觉得没有什么困难能够打倒我，这也和我的经历、个性有关。 9岁那年我爸爸就胃癌去世了，那个时候我就想着长大了当个医生去救别人的命。后来高考的时候，我的志愿填的全部都是医学专业，最后考取了同济医学院。1997年我大学毕业，就到了中心医院，之前在心血管内科工作，2010年到急诊科当主任的。 我觉得急诊科就像我的一个孩子一样，我把它搞成这么大，搞得大家团结起来，做成这个局面不容易，所以很珍惜，非常珍惜这个集体。 前几天，我的一个护士发朋友圈说，好怀念以前忙碌的大急诊，那种忙跟这种忙完全是两个概念。 在这次疫情之前，心梗、脑梗、消化道出血、外伤等等这些才是我们急诊的范畴。那种忙是有成就感的忙，目的明确，针对各种类型的病人都有很通畅的流程，很成熟，下一步干什么，怎么做，出了问题找哪一个。而这一次是这么多危重病人没办法去处理，没办法收住院，而且我们医务人员还在这种风险之中，这种忙真的很无奈，很痛心。 有一天早上8点，我们科一个年轻医生跟我发微信，也是蛮有性格的，说我今天不来上班了，不舒服。因为我们这里都有规矩的，你不舒服要提前跟我说好安排，你到8点钟跟我说，我到哪里去找人。他在微信中对我发脾气，说大量的高度疑似病例被你领导的急诊科放回社会，我们这是作孽！我理解他是因为作为医生的良知，但我也急了，我说你可以去告我，如果你是急诊科主任，你该怎么办？ 后来，这个医生休息了几天后，还是照样来工作。他不是说怕死怕累，而是遇到这种情况，一下子面对这么多病人感到很崩溃。 作为医生来说，特别是后面很多来支援的医生，根本心理上受不了，碰到这种情况懵了，有的医生、护士就哭。一个是哭别人，再一个也是哭自己，因为每个人都不知道什么时候就轮到自己感染。 大概在1月中下旬，医院的领导也陆陆续续地都病倒了，包括我们的门办主任，三位副院长。医务科科长的女儿也病了，他也在家里休息。所以基本上那一段时间是没有人管你，你就在那儿战斗吧，就是那种感觉。 我身边的人也开始一个接一个地倒掉。1月18日，早上8点半，我们倒的第一个医生，他说主任我中招了，不烧，只做了CT，肺部一大坨磨玻璃。不一会儿，隔离病房负责的一个责任护士，告诉我说他也倒了。晚上，我们的护士长也倒了。我当时非常真实的第一感觉是——幸运，因为倒得早，可以早点下战场。 这三个人我都密切接触过，我就是抱着必倒的信念每天在工作，结果一直没倒。全院的人都觉得我是个奇迹。我自己分析了一下，可能是因为我本身有哮喘，在用一些吸入性的激素，可能会抑制这些病毒在肺内沉积。 我总觉得我们做急诊的人都算是有情怀的人——在中国的医院，急诊科的地位在所有科室当中应该是比较低的，因为大家觉得急诊，无非就是个通道，把病人收进去就行了。这次抗疫中，这种忽视也一直都存在。 早期的时候，物资不够，有时候分给急诊科的防护服质量非常差，看到我们的护士竟然穿着这种衣服上班，我很生气，在周会群里面发脾气。后来还是好多主任把他们自己科室藏的衣服都给我了。 还有吃饭问题。病人多的时候管理混乱，他们根本想不到急诊科还差东西吃，很多科室下班了都有吃的喝的，摆一大排，我们这里什么都没有，发热门诊的微信群里，有医生抱怨，「我们急诊科只有纸尿裤……」我们在最前线战斗，结果是这样，有时候心里真的很气。 我们这个集体真的是很好，大家都是只有生病了才下火线。这次，我们急诊科有40多个人感染了。我把所有生病的人建了一个群，本来叫「急诊生病群」，护士长说不吉利，改成「急诊加油群」。就是生病的人也没有很悲伤、很绝望、很抱怨的心态，都是蛮积极的，就是大家互相帮助，共度难关那种心态。 这些孩子们、年轻人都非常好，就是跟着我受委屈了。我也希望这次疫情过后，国家能加大对急诊科的投入，在很多国家的医疗体系中，急诊专业都是非常受重视的。 不能达到的幸福 2月17号，我收到了一条微信，是那个同济医院的同学发给我的，他跟我说「对不起」，我说：幸好你传出去了，及时提醒了一部分人。他如果不传出去的话，可能就没有李文亮他们这8个人，知道的人可能就会更少。 这次，我们有三个女医生全家感染。两个女医生的公公、婆婆加老公感染，一个女医生的爸爸、妈妈、姐姐、老公，加她自己5个人感染。大家都觉得这么早就发现这个病毒，结果却是这样，造成这么大的损失，代价太惨重了。 这种代价体现在方方面面。除了去世的人，患病的人也在承受。 我们「急诊加油群」里，大家经常会交流身体状况，有人问心率总在120次/分，要不要紧？那肯定要紧，一动就心慌，这对他们终身都会有影响的，以后年纪大了会不会心衰？这都不好说。以后别人可以去爬山，出去旅游，他们可能就不行，那都是有可能的。 还有武汉。你说我们武汉是个多热闹的地方，现在一路上都是安安静静的，很多东西买不到，还搞得全国都来支援。前几天广西的一个医疗队的护士在工作的时候突然昏迷了，抢救，后来人心跳有了，但还是在昏迷。她如果不来的话，在家里可以过得好好的，也不会出这种意外。所以，我觉得我们欠大家的人情，真的是。 经历过这次的疫情，对医院里很多人的打击都非常大。我下面好几个医务人员都有了辞职的想法，包括一些骨干。大家之前对于这个职业的那些观念、常识都难免有点动摇——就是你这么努力工作到底对不对？就像江学庆一样，他工作太认真，太对病人好，每一年的过年过节都在做手术。今天有人发一个江学庆女儿写的微信，说她爸爸的时间全部给了病人。 我自己也有过无数次的念头，是不是也回到家做个家庭主妇？疫情之后，我基本上没回家，和我老公住在外面，我妹妹在家帮我照顾孩子。我的二宝都不认得我了，他看视频对我没感觉，我很失落，我生这个二胎不容易，出生的时候他有10斤，妊娠糖尿病我也得了，原本我还一直喂奶的，这一次也断了奶——做这个决定的时候，我有点难过，我老公就跟我说，他说人的一生能够遇到一件这样的事情，并且你不光是参与者，你还要带一个团队去打这场仗，那也是一件很有意义的事情，等将来一切都恢复正常以后大家再去回忆，也是一个很宝贵的经历。 2月21号早上领导和我谈话，其实我想问几个问题，比如有没有觉得那天批评我批评错了？我希望能够给我一个道歉。但是我不敢问。没有人在任何场合跟我说表示抱歉这句话。但我依然觉得，这次的事情更加说明了每个人还是要坚持自己独立的思想，因为要有人站出来说真话，必须要有人，这个世界必须要有不同的声音，是吧？ 作为武汉人，我们哪一个不热爱自己的城市？我们现在回想起来以前过得那种最普通的生活，是多么奢侈的幸福。我现在觉得把宝宝抱着，陪他出去玩一下滑梯或者跟老公出去看个电影，在以前再平常都不过，到现在来说都是一种幸福，都是不能达到的幸福。 By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-24 21:25:55

北岛关闭评论、白睿文微博沦陷：语言暴力作恶者的“打砸抢” 来源：微信公众号-新知时间；Date:2020.04.19;作者：闻溪; 原文地址 1 北岛在豆瓣日记上发布了自己的旧诗作《进程》，评论区遭到一些网友无端谩骂，不得不最终关闭了评论区。 进程 | 北岛 日复一日，苦难 正如伟大的事业般衰败 像一个小官僚 我坐在我的命运中 点亮孤独的国家 死者没有朋友 盲目的煤，嘹亮的灯光 我走在我的疼痛上 围栏以外的羊群 似田野开绽 形式的大雨使石头 变得残破不堪 我建造我的年代 孩子们凭借一道口令 穿过书的防线 这首创作于1993年《进程》，其实是一首非常自我的诗，表达一种知己难求的悲哀，只能“我建造我的年代”。 而在2020的今天，时代似乎已经进步了不止一点，但还是遭到了网络暴力谩骂。 北岛无奈回应是：“这是讨论诗的平台，但不应使用语言的暴力。我从此关闭诗和诗的评价区”。 《进程》最后一句“孩子们凭借一道口令 穿过书的防线”，在2020年还真是讽刺。 2 作为备受国际文坛瞩目、屡获诺贝尔文学奖青睐的诗人北岛，他的诗刺穿了乌托邦的虚伪，呈现出了世界的本来面目。 一句“我不相信”的呐喊，震醒了茫茫黑夜酣睡的人们。“文革”过后，北岛曾发如此义愤之感慨：“卑鄙是卑鄙者的通行证，高尚是高尚者的墓志”。 文革中，几乎所有的人，哪怕是天真烂漫的小孩子，都会喊出诸如“打倒”、“油炸”、“批倒”、“批臭”、“斗倒”、“斗臭”，“踩上一万只脚，叫他永世不得翻身”之类的口号。 但来自“文革”的语言暴力，它留下的潜伏的线索，多年后以这样荒谬的形式，在深深的伤口处爆发，释放妖魔。 方方《武汉日记》的英文译者白睿文（Michael Berry）的微博也被“占领”，直接“寸草不生”。 看到白睿文微博底下的评论我真的深深感到无比羞耻。 运用谩骂甚至种族歧视去侮辱别人以表达自己的政治正确，无比愚蠢又低智。 我们好不容易树立起来的国际形象，就这样被“网络义和团”以这样戏谑的方式肢解。 稍微有点常识的人，都知道白睿文对中国最友好的海外汉学家之一了，这是一位极其热爱、关注、精通中国近代史和当代通俗文化的人。这是一位在课程上要求学生必读《雪山飞狐》英文版的人。 可悲的是，面对这样的语言暴力，白睿文别无选择，只能关闭评论。 白睿文是哥伦比亚大学现代中国文学与电影博士。从1996年开始，他将多部中文长篇小说翻译成英文，其中包括余华的《活着》和王安忆的《长恨歌》等，颇受好评。 读研究生期间，白睿文曾为昆曲演出团体、作家、电影导演和演员做口译。 白睿文曾深度专访侯孝贤、谢晋、张艺谋、李安、杨德昌、贾樟柯等著名华语电影人。多次担任台湾金马奖、香港“新浪潮”电影节、纽约电影节、翠贝卡电影节等电影节评委。他是对于中国现当代文学与电影研究最深入的美国著名学者之一，对中国的宣传不遗余力。 白睿文和儿子讲话只用中文，希望为他从小就创造一个良好的语言学习环境。他教儿子唱中文儿歌“小白兔，白又白……”“小老鼠，上灯台……”，给儿子看中国动画片《巧虎》，甚至游戏《赛车总动员》也买有中文配音的。 为了推广中国文化，他从传统的研究著作、文学翻译、口述历史等方面展开工作，做了采访电影导演的《光影言语》和《煮海时光》。 另外手头上还有几百万字的访谈录都还未出版。这些访谈内容有小说家，电影导演，还有艺术家、建筑家、音乐家等等，日后会陆续出版。 这些发布不堪入目评论的人，其内心是多么肮脏，思想多么下作。 让一直热爱中国文学与中国电影的白睿文多么心寒。 3 这些攻击北岛、白睿文的人难道不知道自己的行为是多么愚蠢吗？ 他们当然知道，只是不敢承认而已，只是为了掩盖自己的“恶”，更是掩盖自己的“暴民心态”。 暴力愈烈，愈有安全感，也就愈有快感，这样，就形成一种以“暴虐为快”的病态心理，乃至形成嗜好语言暴力与借助语言暴力投机的病狂。 热衷肮脏语言手段的人不可能具有干净的人格与干净的目的。语言暴力就像“鸦片”，为了达到自我“高潮”，全然不顾任何形式与坚持。 还真是应了马云在新闻1+1中说的“大概任何国家都有1%左右的脑子撞坏的混蛋，如果我们多关注了1%，而忘掉了99%善良的人群，这是人类的悲剧和悲哀”。 “君子和而不同,小人同而不和”，我们不与“脑子撞坏的混蛋”讨论基本常识，因为常识不言自明。同时，我们必须反对”语言的暴力丶审美的平庸和生活的猥琐。” 成长和成熟永远不是学着去做一个贱人，而是能够清醒地分清善意与恶意。 By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-24 19:58:47

You can completely look over the article by the link I have given above. On December 30, 2019, Affin received a virus test report for patients with unknown pneumonia. She circled the word “SARS coronavirus” in red. When asked by a college student, she took the report and circulated it. To this fellow student who is also a doctor. That night, the report spread to doctor circles in Wuhan, and those who forwarded the report included the eight doctors who were disciplined by the police. This caused trouble for Affin. As the source of the transmission, she was interviewed by the hospital disciplinary committee and suffered “unprecedented and severe rebuke”, saying that she was making rumors as a professional. According to some previous reports, Affin was called “another female doctor who has been instructed to surface,” and some people called her a “whistleblower”. It was the “whistler”. This is the second report of “People” March cover “Doctor Wuhan”. The text message from Affin, the director of the emergency department of Wuhan Central Hospital, agreeing to be interviewed, was sent at 5 am on March 1. About half an hour later, at 5.32 am on March 1, her colleague and director of thyroid and breast surgery Jiang Xueqing was infected with New coronavirus pneumonia, died. Two days later, Mei Zhongming, deputy director of ophthalmology at the hospital, died. He and Li Wenliang were in the same department. As of March 9, 2020, 4 members of the medical staff of Wuhan Central Hospital have died of new coronavirus pneumonia infection. Since the outbreak, this hospital, just a few kilometers away from the Huanan Seafood Market, has become one of the hospitals in Wuhan with the largest number of employees that are infected. According to media reports, more than 200 employees in the hospital were infected, including three deputy deans and multiple working department directors. Multiple department directors are currently being maintained with ECMO(extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). The shadow of death hangs over this, Wuhan’s largest tertiary hospital. A doctor told People[a news site – EB] that in the social media group of hospital staff, almost no one spoke publicly;they mourned and discussed in private. There was a chance to avoid tragedy. On December 30, 2019, Affin received a virus test report for a patient with an unknown pneumonia. She circled the word “SARS coronavirus” in red. When asked by a college classmate who is also a doctor, she took a picture of the report and circulated it. That night, the report spread in doctor circles in Wuhan, and those who forwarded the report included the eight doctors who were disciplined by the police. This caused trouble for Affin. As the original source of the information, she was interviewed by the hospital disciplinary committee and suffered an “unprecedented and severe reprimand”;it was said that she was acting unprofessionally by creating false rumors. In the afternoon of March 2nd, Affin did an interview with People in the Nanjing Road location of Wuhan Central Hospital. She was sitting alone in the emergency room office. The emergency department, which had been admitting more than 1,500 patients a day, had returned to quiet. There was only one tramp lying in the emergency hall. Some previous reports called Affin “another severely reprimanded female doctor who has emerged” and some people called her a “whistleblower”. Affin corrected this; she said she was not a whistleblower, but the one who distributed the \"whistles\". During the interview, Affin mentioned the word “regret” several times, and said she deeply regretted that she hadn't continued to whistle resoundingly after she was reprimanded at a disciplinary review meeting. She has especial regrets when it comes to her deceased coworkers. \"If I had known that today, I wouldn't have cared about being criticized or not, I would have damned said everywhere, right?\" What have Wuhan Central Hospital and Affin experienced in the past two months or so? The following is what Affin told us— An unprecedented reprimand On December 16, last year, we received a patient at the Nanjing Road emergency department. They had an inexplicably high fever, and they weren't responding to the standard medications, their body temperature wasn't going down at all. On the 22nd, the patient was transferred to the respiratory department, a bronchoscopy was done, and bronchoalveolar fluid taken and sent out for high-throughput genetic sequencing. Afterwards, the coronavirus result was relayed verbally. At that time, the colleague who was responsible for the patient told me clearly:\"Director Ai, that person's diagnosis is coronavirus\". Later we learned that the patient was working in the Huanan Seafood Market. Immediately afterwards, December 27th, another patient arrived at Nanjing Road. He was the nephew of a doctor in our department. He was in his 40s, without any preexisting conditions. His lungs were in a terrible state, and his blood oxygen saturation was only 90%. He was under hospital care for almost 10 days without any improvement, and was admitted to the respiratory department. A flexible bronchoscopy was also done, and the alveolar lavage fluid sent for testing. At noon on December 30th, an old classmate at Tongji Hospital sent me a screenshot of a WeChat conversation, which said: “You don’t want to go to Huanan[Market] just now, there are lots of people with high fever …” He asked if it was true. At the time, I was watching a CT[scan] of a typical patient with pulmonary infection on the computer. I sent him a 11-second video of the CT and told him it was a patient who had come to our emergency department in the morning, a Huanan Seafood Market case. Just after 4 pm that day, a colleague showed me a diagnostic report that said:\"SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 strains of bacteria [bacteria and/or fungi] which colonize the oral cavity and/or respiratory tract”. I read the report very carefully many times, and the supplementary information read: “SARS coronavirus is a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus. The main mode of transmission of the virus is close-range droplet transmission or contact with respiratory secretions of patients, which can cause an unusual pneumonia that is highly contagious and can affect multiple organ systems, also known as atypical pneumonia.” At the time, the diagnostic report scared me, I broke into a cold sweat, this was a terrifying thing. The patient was admitted to the respiratory department, the situation needed to be reported to the respiratory department, but to ensure attention, I immediately phoned and reported it to the hospital’s public health division and infectious disease [?院感] division. At that moment, the director of the respiratory department of our hospital happened to be passing my office door, someone who had been involved with SARS. I grabbed the director and said, “We found this in one of the patients in your department.” The director took one look and said it was worrying. I knew the matter was worrying. After calling the hospital, I also circulated this report to my fellow-learners (同学[; student or former classmate]). I purposely drew a red circle around the words “SARS coronavirus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 46 strains of bacteria [菌, bacteria and/or fungi] which colonize the oral cavity and/or respiratory tract” to bring the warning to their attention. I also sent the report to the doctors in the department to warn everyone to take precautions. That evening, the message was spread widely; the screenshots of the transmission show the photos of the report I'd marked with a red circle, including the ones that I later learned that Li Wenliang passed on to the [chat] group. At that time, I was thinking it might be bad. At 10:20, the hospital passed on a message[reportedly on the Central Hospital WeChat group]. It was a relayed notification from the city Health Protection Committee (市卫健委). Their main point was that information on the pneumonia of unknown cause should not be arbitrarily released, to avoid causing panic among the public; if panic was caused by information leakage, there would be a thorough investigation (要追责). I was very scared at the time and immediately passed this information to my fellow-learners. About an hour later, the hospital sent another notice, again stressing that information the group had on this subject could not be leaked. One day later, at 11:46 pm on January 1st, the head of the hospital's disciplinary inspection committee sent me a message to come [for an employee review] the next morning. I didn’t fall asleep that night, I was worried and thought things through over and over again, but I felt that there are always two sides to everything;even if it had caused adverse effects, it was not necessarily a bad thing to remind medical staff in Wuhan to take precautions. At 8 o’clock the next morning, before I finished the shift, I was called in for the disciplinary review. In that disciplinary review, I suffered an unprecedented and very severe reprimand. At that time, the leader of the discussion said, “We ca n’t afford to raise our heads when we go out for a meeting. The director of XX criticizes our hospital. As the director of the emergency department of Wuhan Central Hospital, you are a professional,how can there be this lack of principle, this lack of organizational discipline, this creating and spreading of false rumours ?” This is the original sentence. So I should go back to the 200-odd peeple in the department to convey the news to them verbally, one by one; We can’t send information by WeChat or SMS, we can only talk face-to-face or call, we can’t say anything about this pneumonia, “you can’t even tell your own husband”, they said… I was utterly stunned. I hadn’t been criticized for not working hard, but made to feel that what I’d done had ruined Wuhan’s prospects and its future. I felt strong depair. I am a serious and hard-working person. I felt that everything I had done was in accordance with the rules and well-founded. What did I do wrong? After I red the lab result, I had also reported it to the hospital. My students and my colleagues had communicated among ourselves abouthow to handle the condition of a patient,we hadn't given out any of the patient's personal information;this is equivalent to discussing a medical case among medical students.As a clinical doctor, I already knew that a very important virus had been found in patients. When other doctors asked, how could you not say so? This is your instinct as a doctor, right? What did I do wrong? I have done what a doctor and a person should normally do. I think anyone would do the same. I was very emotional at the time, saying that I had done this, and it had nothing to do with the rest of the people; you can just arrest me and jail me. I said that I was not suitable to continue to work in this position and I wanted to take a break. The leader did not agree, saying that this was the time to test me. I went home that night, I remember it quite clearly, I told my husband just after I walked in the door, if something goes wrong, you must care for and raise the child -- because my second treasure is still very young, only just over 1 year old. At the time, my husband was perplexed by this. I didn’t explain. On January 20th, after Zhong Nanshan[prominent Chinese epidemiologist] told people[about the epidemic], I told my husband what had happened that day. In the interim, I just warned my family not to go to crowded places, and to wear surgical face masks when going out. Peripheral department Many people worry that I was among the eight people who were admonished [by police]. In fact, I wasn't warned by the Public Security Bureau. Later, a good friend asked me, are you a whistleblower? I said that I am not a whistleblower, I am the one who sent the whistle. But that disciplinary review hit me hard, it affected me very severely. When I came back, I could see that everyone’s morale had collapsed. We had been working with such drive and dedication, and doing our jobs conscientiously. Everyone kept asking me questions, and I couldn’t answer. All I could do iwas get the emergency department to focus on protection. We have over 200 people in the emergency department. From January 1st, I asked everyone to strengthen their protection. Everyone must wear masks, hats, and use gloves (用手快消). I remember one day, there was a nurse who did not wear a mask during the shift; I scolded him then and there, saying “Don’t come to work without a mask in the future”. On January 9th,while off-shift, I saw a patient coughing on the pre-examination table. From that day on, I asked everyone to put a mask on both the patient and on anyone seeing the patient, one for each person. I said, don’t try to save money at this time. At the time, they were still telling us that there was no human-to-human transmission, and I want to emphasize here that wearing a mask to strengthen protection was a big issue. That time was really depressing and very painful. Some doctors proposed wearing the out layer of isolation clothing. The hospital’s internal operations committee (医院里开会) said they wouldn’t allow it; they said that wearing isolation clothing would cause panic. I asked the people in the department to wear an isolation gown inside a white coat. This was out-of-specification and ridiculous. We watched more and more patients arrive, as the radius of the infection area became larger and larger. At first, they might be connected to the Huanan Seafood Market; then it spread, and the radius became larger and larger. Many of the cases were family-transmitted. Among the first seven people, there was a case of infection in which the mother had given the son food. The clinic [dispensary? 诊所] boss got sick, infected by the patients who came for injections. It was very serious, whether they got infected or not. I knew there must be human-to-human transmission. If there was no human-to-human transmission, well, the Huanan Seafood Market had been closed on January 1, so why were there more and more patients? I often thought, if only they hadn’t reprimanded me like that, if they’d asked for details calmly, and then asked other respiratory experts to communicate with them, maybe the situation would be better, and I could at least communicate a bit more in the hospital. If everyone had been as alert on January 1, there would not be so many tragedies. On the afternoon of January 3, in the Nanjing Road Hospital, doctors of urology gathered to review the work of the senior director, 43-year-old Dr. Hu Weifeng (胡卫峰), who is now in emergency care; on the afternoon of January 8, the Nanjing Road Hospital Director [of thyroid and breast surgery] Jiang Xueqing (江学庆) also organized the first Wuhan City breast disease patient recovery get-together (武汉市甲乳患者康复联欢会), on the 22nd floor. On the morning of January 11, the department reported to me that Hu Ziwei (胡紫薇), a nurse in the emergency room of the emergency department, was infected. She’d be the first infected nurse in the central hospital. First-off, I called the Chief of the Medical Department to report it, and then the hospital held an emergency meeting. At the meeting we were instructed to change the report of “double lung infection, viral pneumonia?” to “scattered infection of both lungs” (“两下肺感染，病毒性肺炎？” to “两肺散在感染”). At the weekly meeting of January 16th, a deputy dean was still saying, “Everyone must have a little medical common sense, and certain senior doctors should not go about scaring people.” Another leader spoke, and continued, ”Human-to-human transmission is not possible; it can be prevented, treated and controlled.“ One day later, on January 17, Jiang Xueqing was hospitalized, and 10 days later he was intubated and put on ECMO. The toll at the central hospital is so large, and it’s connected to the lack of transparency for our medical staff. If you look at the people who fell ill, the emergency department and the respiratory department suffered less heavily, because we had a sense of the need for protection, and we knew we should quickly rest and get treatment as soon as we got sick. The worst cases are in the peripheral departments; Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist, and Jiang Xueqing is a nail specialist. Jiang Xueqing was really a very good person, with excellent medical skills. He held one of the two Chinese Physician Awards in the hospital. And yet we were neighbors, we were a unit; I’m located on the 40th floor, he was on the 30th floor, our working relationship was very good, but because I am too busy at work, I only met him during meetings and hospital activities. He was a workaholic, always either in the operating room or at the clinic. No one would go to tell him specifically, “Director Jiang, you have to pay attention and wear a mask”. He didn’t have the time and energy to inquire about these things, and he must have brushed it off with: “What’s the matter? It’s pneumonia.” This was what people in that department told me. If these doctors had been warned in time, perhaps this day wouldn’t have come. So that’s why, as one closely involved, I regret what I did. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn’t have cared about the reprimand, I would have [expletive] spoken of it everywhere, to everyone, wouldn’t I? Although I worked in the same hospital as Li Wenliang (李文亮) did before he died, I didn’t know him, because the hospital had over 4,000 people on staff and was usually busy. The night before his death, the director of the ICU called me to borrow a cardiac press (心脏按压器; CPR device?) from the emergency department, and said it was Li Wenliang who was going to be resuscitated. The news shocked me. I do not understand everything that happened to Li Wenliang, but could his condition have been affected by his emotional state after being reprimanded? I have to ask, with my experience; I felt it myself. Later, when things got to this point, it proved that Li Wenliang was right. I can understand his state of mind very easily. It could be my own. I don’t feel excitement or happiness, but regret. Regret that I didn’t continue to shout out loudly at the beginning, when people intervened and scolded us. I often find myself thinking, if only we could turn back time, and do it right. Just surviving is good On the night before the city was shut down on January 23, a friend from the relevant department called to ask me about the true situation of emergency patients in Wuhan. I said, are you asking in a private or public capacity? He said, private. [I said,] I will tell you the truth when I speak on my behalf: On January 21, our emergency department saw 1,523 patients, three times as many as usual, of which 655 had fever. The situation in the emergency department during that time will never be forgotten by those who experienced it, it completely changes your outlook on life. If this is a war, the emergency department is the front line. But at the time, the inpatient wards were saturated, and basically none of the patients were accepted, and the ICU was resolutely refused to accept them. They said that there were uninfected patients in them, and they became contaminated as soon as they entered. More patients kept rushing in to the emergency department, and the inpatient beds were not open, so they all piled up in the emergency department. Patients queued for a few hours to see a doctor. We couldn’t take any time off work at all. There was no distinction between the fever clinic and the emergency department. The hall was full of patients. The emergency room, the IV room, everywhere was filled with patients. Another patient’s family came in, wanting a bed for their dad, who couldn’t make it in from the car, because the underground garage was closed at the time, and the car couldn’t get in. I couldn’t do anything about that, but I ran to the car with people and equipment. I saw immediately that he was already dead. What can you say, it’s very difficult to bear. The man died in the car, he didn’t even get out of the car. There was also an old man, his wife had just died at Jinyintan Hospital, her son and daughter were infected, and she was given an IV, her son-in-law was caring for her. As soon as I saw that she was very ill, I contacted the respiratory department to admit her to the hospital. Her son-in-law was obviously a cultured person. He came over and wished to thank the doctor and so on. As a result, she died. It only took a few seconds, but it was a delay of a few seconds. That quick “thank you” weighs heavily on me. And yet there were many people who sent their families to the ward (监护室[; guardianship room]? in the sense of trustee), and that’s the last time you’l see them, you’ll never see them again. I remember when I came to work on the morning of the Chinese New Year [Friday, January 24, 2020]. I said that we’d take a picture to commemorate the New Year. I also sent it to a circle of friends. No one wished anyone a happy new year that day. At the time, just surviving was good. In the past, if you made a small mistake, for example, if you didn’t give an injection in time, the patient might still be in trouble. Now there’s no one, no one is to raise it with you, no-one is going to take issue with it. Everyone’s overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught, we work blindly. The patients died, and it was rare to see family members weeping and grieving, because there were too many, too many. Some family members didn’t say “Doctor, please save my family”, but said to the doctor, “Right, let’s do this quickly”; it came to that. Everyone was afraid of being infected. The queue at the fever clinic was 5 hours long, every day. A woman waiting in line collapsed, a woman in a leather coat, with a purse and high heels, very carefully dressed. A middle-aged woman; no one dared to step forward to help her, and she lay on the ground for a long time. I had to call the nurse and doctor to help her. On the morning of January 30, I came to work. The son of a white-haired old man had died at the age of 32. He stared blankly at the doctor giving him the death certificate. There are no tears at all, how can one cry? There’s no way to cry. From the style of his clothing, the old man might be a rural migrant worker, there’s no way to be sure. Without a diagnosis, his son became a death certificate. This is what I want to call for. The patients who died in the emergency department were all undiagnosed, and their causes of death could not be confirmed. After this epidemic has passed, I hope to give an explanation and give their families some comfort. Our patients wake compassion, a great deal of compassion. “Lucky” Having been a doctor for so many years, I always felt that no difficulty could overwhelm me, not with my experience and personality. When I was nine, my father died of gastric cancer. At that time, I thought of growing up to be a doctor, to save the lives of others. Later, when I did my the college entrance examination, all my preferences were in medicine, and I finally got to go to Tongji Medical College. After graduating from medical college in 1997, I went to the Central Hospital. I previously worked in cardiovascular medicine, and I became the director of the emergency department in 2010. I feel the emergency department is one of my children. I built it up, I nurtured a tight-knit group, which really doesn’t make this situation easier, but it’s what makes this group such a treasure; I really cherish this team. A few days ago, one of my nurses sent a message to a friends group saying “I really miss the old big busy emergency department”; that kind of busy and this kind of busy are totally different concepts. Before this epidemic hit, our emergency department dealt with myocardial infarctions, cerebral infarctions, gastrointestinal bleeding, trauma and so on. That kind of busy gives a sense of accomplishment, it has a clear purpose, there’s a smooth flow of procedures for all the various types of patients. There are very mature procedures, there’s not a single wasted step, what to do next is not a problem. But in this time there were so many critically ill patients whom we had no way to deal with and who couldn’t be admitted to hospital, and our medical staff was still at risk. This kind of busyness is desperate, it’s deeply distressing. One day at 8 in the morning, a young doctor in our department sent me a WeChat, and it was quite personal, saying they wouldn’t come to work that day, not well. Since what we do here, if someone is not well, they need to tell me about it in advance; if they tell me at 8 o’clock, where do I go to find someone? The doctor lost their temper with me in WeChat, and said that a large number of highly suspect cases were put back into the community by the emergency department I led. We understand that this is sin! I understand this person, because this is a doctor’s professional ethics, but I was also anxious, and I said you can denounce me, but tell me, what would you do if you were the director of the emergency department? Later, the doctor came back to work after a few days of rest. The doctor didn’t say that they feared death or feared harm; no, they were affected the conditions; suddenly having to deal with so many patients at once, they felt utterly overwhelmed. And the work of the medics, especially for the many medics who came to support us, it was psychologically unbearable. There were doctors and nurses in tears. Some were crying for others, others were crying for themselves, because no-one knows when it will be their turn to become infected. Around mid-to-late January, the hospital’s leaders also became ill, one after another, including our director of the office and three vice-presidents. The daughter of the Chief of Medical Services was also ill and resting at home. So basically there was no administration or management; you just had to fight there, that was the feeling. The people around me also started to come down with it one by one. On January 18, at 8:30 in the morning, our first doctor collapsed, saying “I caught it just like the director did”, no fever, did a CT first off, and the lungs had a lump of ground-glass opacification (坨磨玻璃). Not long after, the duty nurse in charge of the isolation ward told me they’d fallen ill. That night, our head nurse fell ill. My very real first feeling at that time was — good luck, because falling ill early, you could get off the battlefield for a little bit. I’ve been in close contact with these three people. I just work every day with the belief that I must fall ill. Everyone in the hospital thought I was a miracle. I’ve thought about it myself, perhaps it’s because I have asthma and I’m using some inhaled hormones, perhaps it inhibits the deposition of these viruses in the lungs. I’ve always felt that the people who work in the emergency department have feelings, too. In Chinese hospitals, the status of the emergency department is relatively low among the departments, because everyone thinks that the emergency department is nothing more than a route into the hospital, it just needs to admit patients. During this epidemic, this sort of neglect has always been present. In the early days, they’re weren’t enough supplies. Sometimes the quality of the protective clothing assigned to the emergency department was very poor. I was angry when I saw that our nurses wore such clothes to work and spoke up about it in Zhouhui Qun[a WeChat group for MDs in that hospital]. After that, many directors gave me all the protective clothing they kept in their departments. There were also problems with food. When there are many patients, the management gets confused. They simply can’t think that the emergency department still has to have something to eat. Many departments had food and drink after shift changeover, they had a big spread, and here, we had nothing. In the fever clinic’s WeChat group, doctors complained: “Our emergency department has only disposable diapers…” We were the front-line response, and we had to deal with that sort of thing, sometimes it made me really angry. Our team is really good. Everyone held the line, they were only off work when they were sick. More than 40 people in our emergency department were infected. I built a group of all the sick people, originally called the “Emergency Department Sick Group”(急诊生病群); the head nurse said that was unlucky, and changed it to “Emergency Department Re-energizing Group” (急诊加油群). Even the people who are sick weren’t thinking in terms of despair or blame. They were all very positive, that is, everyone had the attitude that we needed to help one another to get thorough the crisis together. These kids, these young people are very good, it’s just that they, like me, have to live with feeling slighted. I hope that after this epidemic, the country will also increase its investment in emergency departments. In many countries’ medical systems, the emergency department is highly valued. Unattainable happiness On February 17th, I received a WeChat message from the old classmate at Tongji Hospital. He said “Sorry” to me. I said: it’s fortunate that you passed the message on and warned some people in time. If he hadn’t passed it on, they might not have Li Wenliang and the eight others, but people would probably know less. This time, we had the entire families of three female doctors get infected. Two female doctors had their father-in-law and mother-in-law infected, and their husbands, and another had her father, mother, sister, and husband infected, and five close relatives. Everyone thinks that the virus was discovered so early on, and yet this is the result, it caused us such great loss, took such a terrible toll. It took this toll in many different ways, too. In addition to those who died, those who were sick also suffered. In our “Emergency Department Re-energizing group”, people often exchange physical conditions. Some people ask: a heart rate that’s always 120 beats per minute, does it matter? Surely it matters, they panic as soon as they move. This will affect them for life, and is heart failure likely? It’s hard to say. In the future, others will be able to go hiking and traveling, and they might not be able to, all that is possible. And Wuhan. You said that our Wuhan is a lively place; now it’s very, very quiet on the streets. Many things can’t be bought and we have to support the whole country. A few days ago, a nurse of a medical team in Guangxi suddenly fell into a coma while at work, and was resucitated. Her heart restarted, but she is still in a coma. If she hadn’t come to work, she could have had a good time at home, and this kind of thing wouldn’t have happened. So, I think we owe everyone, really. Having been through this epidemic, many people in the hospital have been hit hard. Several medical staff below me have thoughts of resignation, including some backbones of the department. Everyone’s previous ideas, all the things everyone knows about this profession, they’re are inevitably a little shaken — it’s that you work so hard, isn’t it? Just like Jiang Xueqing, he worked too hard, he was too good to the patients, he was doing surgery every year during [Chinese] New Year. Today, someone sent a WeChat written by Jiang Xueqing’s daughter, saying that her father’s time was all given to his patients. Myself, I’ve had countless thoughts of going back home to be a housewife. After the epidemic began, I basically didn’t go home, I lived separately from my husband. My sister helped take care of my children at home. My second treasure didn’t recognize me, didn’t react to me when he saw me on video. I felt very lost. It wasn’t easy for me to give birth to this second child. He was 10 kg at birth. I had to wean him abruptly — when I made that decision, that was hard for me to do. My husband told me that these things happen in life, and you’re not only a participant, you’re also choosing to lead the team to fight this epidemic; that’s also a very meaningful act, and when everything returns to normal for everyone, then you’ll remember; it’s a valuable experience to have had. The leader (领导) talked to me on the morning of February 21st. Actually, I would have liked to ask a few questions, such as, do you think that that criticism was wrong that day? I hoped to be given an apology. But I dared not ask. No one said sorry to me on any occasion. I still feel that these events are an even clearer demonstation of why each person should stick to their own independent ideas, regardless, because if someone wants to stand up and tell the truth, there must be someone, and the world must hear a dissenting voice, right? I’m Wuhanese, who doesn’t love their own city? Now we remember what extravagant happiness we enjoyed in the most ordinary life. I now feel that holding the baby, going out to play with him on a slide, or going out to watch a movie with my husband, which is common in the past, are a kind of happiness, unachievable happiness.

More than 100 international politicians and international policy experts have signed on to the letter, including former Canadian justice minister and human rights advocate Irwin Cotler. In it, the signatories warn that the coronavirus crisis shows it is more important than ever to raise up and listen to independent voices in China given the regime’s silencing of experts who tried to raise alarm bells. “China’s Chernobyl moment is a self-inflicted wound,” the letter states. “The CCP [Communist Party of China] silenced Chinese doctors who wanted to warn other health professionals during the early stage of the outbreak.” It goes on to criticize the World Health Organization for bowing to Chinese pressure to downplay the severity of the situation. That’s a criticism that the organization has been facing now for months. There have been repeated intelligence leaks in recent weeks casting doubt on the official case numbers of the novel coronavirus reported by China to the World Health Organization. Bloomberg first reported on April 1 that the American intelligence community concluded in a classified report for the Trump administration that China’s reporting on coronavirus cases and deaths was faked. That report cited three U.S. intelligence officials calling the data from China “intentionally incomplete.” The following day, the New York Times reported that the CIA had been warning the American administration since early February that China’s coronavirus tallies could not be trusted. The intelligence officials cited in that report said a likely cause was that health officials in Wuhan, China had been hiding the real numbers out of fear of losing their jobs. In the open letter, the experts say that in that coverup lies “the roots of the pandemic.” They urge people around the world to confront “an inconvenient truth” about China. “By politicizing all aspects of life including people’s health, continued autocratic one-party rule in the People’s Republic of China has endangered everyone,” they write, suggesting that the intentions of the Communist Party of China can no longer be trusted. “We should pay greater attention to the voices of what can be termed ‘unofficial’ China. These independent-minded academics, doctors, entrepreneurs, citizen journalists, public interest lawyers and young students no longer accept the CCP’s rule by fear. Neither should you.” Other signatories to the letter include U.K. MP Damian Collins, who chaired the international grand committee examining privacy and social media misinformation last year, along with members of Parliament from Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, the European Parliament and the U.K. There are also several former ministers of foreign affairs, defence and home affairs, along with a broad range of civil society advocates and academics, including Canadian writer Jonathan Manthorpe. No Canadian members of Parliament from any party signed the letter. Canadian Health Minister Patty Hajdu earlier this month attacked a journalist who asked about whether China’s data can be trusted, criticizing them as “feeding conspiracy theories.” By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-24 19:58:47 "},"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/":{"url":"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/","title":"The Moderates","keywords":"","body":" By Pyrhae，使用知识共享 署名-相同方式共享 4.0协议发布            此页面修订于： 2020-04-24 19:58:47 "},"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/The_World_After_Coronavirus.html":{"url":"chap02English_Materials/The_Moderates/The_World_After_Coronavirus.html","title":"The World After Coronavirus","keywords":"","body":"The World After Coronavirus Source: Financial Times, by Yuval Noah Harari March 20 2020; Address One comment which is liked by most totally says what I want to say to this Article.
